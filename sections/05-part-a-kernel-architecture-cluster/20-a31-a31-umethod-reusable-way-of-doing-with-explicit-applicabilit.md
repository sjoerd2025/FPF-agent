## A.3.1 - U.Method: Reusable Way of Doing with Explicit Applicability

> **Type:** Definitional pattern
> **Status:** Stable
> **Normativity:** Normative

### A.3.1:1 - Problem frame

When several observed Work occurrences or named sources may show a reusable way but Method identity is still only a candidate, use `A.3.1.MR` first. It returns one source-traceable account per candidate, a distinguishing question, a record-only result, or a named blocker. Return here only when one candidate reusable way is ready for the `U.Method` identity test.

Use this pattern when a project needs to say **how something is done in principle**.

Typical moments:

* a team infers method identity solely from code, a BPMN diagram, or a solver model, or treats a workflow description as evidence of performed Work;
* a practice, procedure, protocol, proof script, optimization model, control strategy, or recipe is intended for reuse across many runs;
* two descriptions look different but may describe the same way of doing;
* a graph, query, table, dashboard, checklist predicate, or mathematical representation is being interpreted as if it were an instruction sequence;
* work planning, dated Work, MethodDescription, formal substrate, mechanism, system-role assignment, cultural-evolution, discipline, and evidence are starting to collapse into one vague "method" or "practice" word.

**Primary EntityOfConcern.** The `EntityOfConcern` is the `U.Method`: one reusable semantic way of doing under stated participant meanings, applicability, preconditions, intended effects or preserved conditions, and bounds. Cite an exact effective reference scheme and local senses only when their variation changes that method meaning. `U.Method` is a non-agentive holon kind: methods can have submethods, compose into whole methods, and participate as submethods of larger methods. A step label or step description is not a method part unless the recovered object is itself a `U.Method`.

**First useful move.** Name the reusable way of doing, its generic participant meanings, applicability, preconditions, intended effect or preserved condition, and the concern it addresses—for example changing, observing, comparing, classifying, evaluating, communicating, selecting, proving, or preserving. If local terminology changes that answer, cite the exact effective reference scheme and local senses.

**What goes wrong if missed.** Readers may mistake a diagram for work authorization, a query plan for performed work, a program for proof of operational success, or a graph path for a route actually followed.

**What this buys.** The project can reuse, compare, describe, plan, enact, and audit a way of doing without confusing the method with its descriptions, runs, mechanisms, mathematical substrates, evidence relations, gates, or authority claims.

**Not this pattern when.** If the sentence is about a document or representation that describes a method, schedules work, reports dated Work, declares a mechanism, presents a mathematical lens, cites evidence, decides a gate, asserts authority, or publishes a view, use the pattern that defines or tests that claim. For a claim-bearing episteme about one exact Method, apply A.3.2's same-individual membership test; a carrier or representation is not thereby linked directly to the Method. State any planning, enactment, realization, evidence, gate, authority, publication, or representation relation only under its subject pattern when it actually obtains.

### A.3.1:2 - Problem

Without a current `U.Method` distinction, FPF cannot repair method-like wording cleanly. Texts then slide among several different claims:

1. **Description as method.** A SOP, code repository, proof script, BPMN diagram, SQL query, solver model, or protocol is treated as the method itself.
2. **Plan or run as method.** A calendar plan, access plan, run log, telemetry trace, or work-result record is called the method.
3. **Mechanism or formal substrate as method.** A mathematical object, formal substrate, mechanism declaration, causal model, or control structure is used as if it already selected the way of doing work.
4. **System-role or capability leakage.** Named people, organizations, teams, permissions, system-role assignments, or a particular holder's capability assessment are baked into the Method instead of remaining with their direct classification, assignment, authority, capability, or gate patterns.
5. **Programming-paradigm overread.** Imperative, functional, logical, constraint, object-centric event, or effect-handler wording is taken as a direct ontology of work rather than one possible description or representation of a way of doing.

The practical harm is fragile reliance. Changing a publication looks like changing the method; a run error looks like method invalidation; a mechanism declaration starts authorizing work; and a dashboard cue starts acting like evidence or permission.

### A.3.1:3 - Forces

* A method has enough identity stability to support comparison, reuse, teaching, improvement, and audit across many runs.
* Work still happens in dated situations with exact performer assignments, actual participants, resource uses, conditions, and separately governed effects; a method statement establishes none of those occurrence-side facts.
* Method descriptions can be executable, formal, graphical, procedural, declarative, or hybrid; publication form alone does not decide the method ontology.
* Mechanisms and mathematical substrates often make a method explainable or constrained enough to rely on, but the mechanism claim and the method claim still answer different project questions.
* A useful method statement remains applicable to welding, clinical triage, proof construction, optimization, agent orchestration, lab protocols, software execution, and organizational work without making software notation the default model of method.

### A.3.1:4 - Solution

`U.Method` is the **reusable semantic way of doing under stated applicability**.

**Local method mantra.** *Name the reusable way; say who or what it is for and when; state the intended result or preserved condition and any applicable limit or stop condition; add an effective reference scheme or a selected structure only if changing it would change the method identification or the next decision; keep descriptions, plans, Work occurrences, and mechanisms separate.* Use this as an attention aid.

It is a non-agentive holon kind. Part methods can be selected, bounded, ordered, joined, adapted, and hidden or exposed through method interfaces to form a whole method with whole-level preconditions, effects, invariants, constraints, and assurance hooks. The whole method may then be used as a part method in a larger method.

A `U.Method` is:

* **semantically local**: its identity uses the declared participant meanings, applicability, conditions, intended effects or preserved conditions, and bounds; add an effective reference scheme and local senses only when a meaning difference would change the method identification or a stated comparison;
* **semantic**: it is the way of doing that descriptions denote and work may enact;
* **concern-explicit**: it states what a future enactment is intended to do or decide and its intended effect or preserved condition;
* **description-independent**: one method may be described by several `U.MethodDescription` epistemes;
* **run-independent**: one method may be enacted by many Work occurrences admitted under `U.Work`;
* **assignment-independent**: Method admission conditions may name local system-role kinds or capability-fit conditions, but named holders and obtaining assignments belong elsewhere;
* **participant-semantic**: it may state generic participant meanings and method-side applicability without declaring `RelationSignature` SlotSpecs, `OperationAlgebra` argument or result positions, planned fillers, or actual participants.

Do not begin by replacing *method* or *practice* with a preferred technical word. First finish the ordinary sentence, "Here the text is trying to name or assert `___`." Then use this table:


| If the text is really about... | Govern it as... |
| --- | --- |
| semantic way of doing | `A.3.1 U.Method` |
| relation or composition among methods, method families, method-description epistemes, or local method expressions | `C.2.1` or the exact comparison/direct-relation pattern for an actual relation among description epistemes; `A.22` only for a selected structure whose constituent relations already obtain; `G.5` and `A.19` for family selection; `A.15.1` for `enactsMethod`; `B.1.5` for order-sensitive method composition; `C.29` for graph or algebraic representation |
| description of that way of doing: SOP, program, proof script, solver model, protocol, diagram, process model, recipe text | `A.3.2 U.MethodDescription` |
| source phrase such as *practice*, *technique*, *school*, *tradition*, or a local method label whose claim is unclear | leave it unresolved until the sentence identifies a reusable way, description, discipline or tradition, or model-use boundary; use `A.1.1` for the bounded-context or model-use claim and `C.36.P` for the cultural-evolution, tradition, style, canon, recognition, selection, or mediation claim |
| selected formal declaration or mathematical lens | `A.6.0` for the declaration; `C.29` when a stated use applies the mathematical lens |
| mechanism declaration or realization relation | `A.6.1` and `E.20` |
| system-role assignment, relation among exact system-role kinds, direct responsibility relation, or holder eligibility hidden under a practice or Method phrase | `A.2`, `A.2.1`, `A.2.7`, `A.6.RCD`, and `A.15` as applicable |
| planned dated work or authorization to prepare work | `A.15.2 U.WorkPlan` plus the relevant gate, authority, or commitment pattern |
| dated work occurrence or run; trace, log, or result record | Use `A.15.1` for the dated Work. Route a separate record or result by what it asserts—measurement, evaluation, production, delivery, acceptance, or evidence—and link it to Work only through a relation whose predicate and participants are defined by its direct pattern or declaration. |
| field, bounded-context or model-use, discipline or tradition, recognition or selection, mediation, variant, or cultural-evolution claim | Use `A.1.1` for a bounded-context or model-use claim; `C.20`, `C.36`, or `C.36.P` for a discipline, tradition, canon, or cultural-evolution claim; and `F.17`, `F.18`, `F.9`, `C.18`, `C.19`, `G.5`, or `G.11` only after the sentence names its sense, recognition, mediation, variant, selection, or currentness claim. |
| evidence or provenance relation for a claim | `A.10` |
| graph path, query, table, dashboard, publication face, or pattern relation made to prescribe action by its layout | apply `C.2.P.DR`, then state the actual method, Work, gate, or authority claim—or stop when none is present |

#### A.3.1:4.0a - Strategy wording by claim position

Treat `strategy` as ordinary source wording until the sentence's claim position is clear. Do not mint `U.Strategy`.

When the wording names a reusable way of deciding or acting under stated applicability, it identifies a `U.Method`. A clinical treatment strategy, manufacturing setup strategy, search strategy, or negotiation strategy qualifies only when it states the reusable action, participant meanings, preconditions, intended result, and bounds.

When a protocol, playbook, program, diagram, or prose passage describes that way, that episteme may be a `U.MethodDescription`. Reusable strategizing can itself be a `U.Method`; a dated strategy workshop, search episode, or planning session is a Work individual only when its A.15.1 occurrence basis is grounded.

When the sentence is about choosing among candidates, use `A.19.SelectorMechanism` and G.5 for the actual criteria, policy, and selector outcome. The label *strategy* does not replace those objects or prove that a reusable method has been stated.

Leave quoted or explanatory *strategy* wording alone when it carries no FPF claim. The repair is complete when a reader can say what the sentence asserts and which pattern contains the defining content for that assertion, not when every occurrence has been replaced.

#### A.3.1:4.1 - Thin first-use method identification

Start with the least apparatus that lets another reader recognize the same method:

1. **Ordinary use.** State the reusable way of doing, the kinds of participants it is for, when it applies, what it is meant to achieve or preserve, and any applicable use limits or stop conditions. If that sentence is enough for the decision at hand, stop.
2. **Later comparison or reliance.** Use the needed entries in the Plain aid below when the ordinary statement is insufficient for another person to distinguish same-named methods, compare descriptions or variants, cite one edition in a plan, or audit why this method was selected.
3. **Organization of several methods or uses.** Open `A.22`, `B.1.5`, or another direct composition pattern only when the question is about the organization itself—for example, which methods were composed, selected, used as fallbacks, or enacted in the reviewed work.

Moving to a heavier level must solve one of those concrete problems.

The following is a Plain identification aid, not a record kind, ontic, serialization, or mandatory form. Omit every optional line that the stated decision does not use.

```text
Method identification aid:
  MethodRef:
  SemanticBasisIfMeaningVaries:
  Applicability:
  GenericParticipantMeanings:
  MethodConcern:
  Preconditions:
  IntendedResultOrPreservedCondition:
  MethodDescriptionIfReliedOn:
  WorkRelationIfReliedOn:
  SelectedStructureOrModelUseIfReliedOn:
  RelationsThatMustObtain:
  RelianceWindow:
  ReviewIf:
  NotEstablished (ClaimBoundary):
```

Use `NotEstablished` only for a stronger reading that passes F.19:4's plausible-reader guard test. State the smallest clear correction; omit the entry when the positive identification suffices. Use the FPF term `ClaimBoundary` when a named neighboring subject assertion depends on that boundary.

Add `SemanticBasisIfMeaningVaries` only when the same words have different meanings under another effective reference scheme or set of local senses. Add a claim scope, context slice, selected structure, or model-use relation only when its own predicate obtains and changing it would change the method identification or the later decision.

For every relied-on relation, name its participants, the relation that must obtain, and the pattern that defines or constrains it. A generic `source`, `support`, `evidence`, or `current use` entry is not a replay basis. `RelianceWindow` states the temporal conditions under which the comparison is relied on. Identify the compared Method variants and relied-on description editions separately. `ReviewIf` names the concrete change that would make that comparison unsafe.

#### A.3.1:4.1a - Closure and bounded non-use

Close positively when a reader can write the reusable action, generic participant meanings, applicability, preconditions, intended result or preserved condition, and any use limit or stop condition that changes the identification or decision. Resolve an effective reference scheme and local senses only when a meaning difference changes that answer. Cite a method description, selected structure, model-use relation, or Work relation only when the next decision depends on that relation.

If the project also claims an actual change, finish the method identification first. Then open A.3.4 for the actual changed referent, temporal boundary, subject facts, and transformation identity.

Close by non-use when the source is only a description, plan, dated Work occurrence, mechanism declaration, selector result, system-role-kind relation, another direct relation, evidence relation, publication use, or quoted wording. If the material does not distinguish those positions, retain the source phrase as an unresolved cue and stop rather than inferring `U.Method`.

#### A.3.1:4.2 - Method and mechanism settlement

Do not decide from words such as *method*, *algorithm*, *process*, or *mechanism*. First ask what the sentence lets the project assert:

| Plain question | Answer and pattern to use |
| --- | --- |
| What reusable way of observing, deciding, deriving, changing, or preserving is meant? | State the `U.Method` under A.3.1: participants, applicability, conditions, intended result or preserved condition, and boundary. |
| What reusable family of operations and laws is declared? | State the separate `U.Mechanism` declaration under A.6.1: its concern, subject and range meanings, operation algebra, laws, admissibility conditions, and Applicability. |
| What happened on this dated occasion? | Recover every exact actual performer and its obtaining system-role assignment through A.13, then identify the dated Work occurrence independently under A.15.1. Its enacted Method, extent, containing System, bindings, and resources are occurrence-side facts. Add F.6 attribution through that same assignment only when the receiving claim expressly consumes precise assignment-bound attribution; missing or failed F.6 attribution does not erase the independently admitted Work. |
| What correspondence, realization, or support claim is being made around those objects? | Name the relation, its participants, exact predicate, current facts, and subject-pattern locator. If no such predicate is defined, keep the objects separate and stop rather than implying the relation. |

A method statement may cite a mechanism episteme whose content declares operations used by that method. A shared concern or operation name does not make the two values identical. A selector may choose a method, and an A.6.1 application may bind a method as an actual value. State that use only when the selector outcome, application binding, or another admitted direct relation is present; otherwise keep the method and neighboring object separate.

Keep the nearby relation families distinct once, here. An F.9 Bridge between two exact F.17 `SchemeSenseCell` values states a cross-context sense correspondence; it does not change an effective reference scheme or establish identity. A claim that this Bridge suits one named use remains a separate C.2.1 bounded-use claim. A.10 governs bounded reliance on that claim; use B.3 only for an actual named assurance claim. An A.6.1 realization relation connects a mechanism declaration to a realizer; it is not the mechanism content. C.29 governs a mathematical preservation or representation claim. E.20 governs where mechanism meaning is maintained. Evaluation, measurement, and evidence-use patterns support their own claims; they do not add content to the method or mechanism.

When neither the reusable way nor the reusable operation declaration can be stated, keep the source wording unresolved. Replacing it with a more technical noun is not a repair.

#### A.3.1:4.3 - Method, MethodDescription, WorkPlan, Work

Keep the four positions separate.

| Position | What it means | Common mistaken substitutes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `U.Method` | how in principle, for stated participants, applicability, conditions, effects, and bounds | code, SOP, graph, solver model, proof script, workflow diagram |
| `U.MethodDescription` | an episteme that describes a method in a representation | method semantics, actual run, authority to work |
| `U.WorkPlan` | planned dated work or work preparation | timeless method, generic recipe, proof that work happened |
| `U.Work` | admitted kind for dated Work occurrences; one Work individual is one world-side occurrence | method, plan, result interpretation, evidence relation, or record about the occurrence |

The same solver model, repository, protocol, diagram, or run packet may figure in several claims, so say what each sentence is about. The solver-model episteme may describe a method; its mathematical representation may expose a C.29 formal substrate; a dated solver run may be Work; and a measurement or evaluation result may support another claim through its evidence relation.

#### A.3.1:4.4 - Method statement fields

A useful `U.Method` statement can usually answer these questions in ordinary project language:

| Field | What to name |
| --- | --- |
| Method name | the reusable semantic way of doing |
| Semantic basis when needed | the effective reference scheme and local senses whose variation would change the method meaning |
| Applicability | the candidate family, conditions, limits, and qualification window under which the way of doing applies |
| Method concern | what future enactments are intended to change, observe, compare, classify, evaluate, communicate, select, derive, prove, control, produce, or preserve; this is reusable semantic content, not an actual occurrence |
| Preconditions | states already in effect for the method to be applicable |
| Effects or postconditions | what successful enactment is meant to produce or preserve |
| Generic participant and boundary meanings | the kinds of entities, resources, conditions, interfaces, and Method-side local system-role-kind or capability-fit conditions that a future enactment may involve, without declaring `RelationSignature` SlotSpecs, `OperationAlgebra` positions, planned fillers, or actual participants |
| Capability acceptance conditions | Method-side thresholds or envelopes required for use; state the actual holder capability and its assessment separately under A.2.2. A changed requirement that matters to Method identity follows §4.7. |
| Failure and stop conditions | when the method cannot be used, when a description no longer states it accurately, and when planned Work must not enter its gate |
| Method-description membership | which epistemes, if any, meet A.3.2 membership for this exact Method; any comparison or plan must separately name the edition and claims it uses |
| Work relation | When the receiving use relies on actual enactment, name the admitted Work and obtaining `enactsMethod` relation in its separate assertion or record; cite a MethodDescription only when that use relies on its claims. |

This table is a recognition checklist, not a data schema. Start with the ordinary method sentence. Use A.6.1 for a reusable operation declaration, A.6.5 for a reusable direct-relation declaration, A.15.2 for planned use, and the exact direct relation or A.6.1 application binding for actual participation.

#### A.3.1:4.5 - Representation and programming-paradigm discipline

A `U.Method` need not be written as an imperative sequence. A way of doing may be described or represented through code, rules, constraints, process diagrams, SQL queries, proof scripts, optimization models, or functional or effect-handler programs.

Choose by the claim being made:

* If the sentence states the reusable action, participants, applicability, intended result, and boundary, use A.3.1.
* If it points to code, prose, a protocol, diagram, solver model, or other episteme that describes the method, use A.3.2. Use A.6.0 or C.29 when the claim is instead about a formal declaration or mathematical representation.
* If it declares a law-governed operation family or asks where that declaration is maintained, use A.6.1 or E.20.
* If it schedules future work or reports a dated occurrence, use A.15.2 or A.15.1.
* If it claims evidence, provenance, or support, use A.10 and the direct evaluation or measurement pattern. If a representation's form or layout is being treated as sufficient to prescribe or authorize action, apply C.2.P.DR before choosing the pattern for that claim.

Keep cross-context and application claims separate from those five choices. F.9 governs a Bridge between two exact F.17 `SchemeSenseCell` values. A claim that this Bridge suits one named use remains separate under C.2.1. A.10 governs bounded reliance on that claim; use B.3 only for an actual named assurance claim. C.2.1, A.6.3, A.6.3.RT, A.6.4, or A.1.1 governs an actual change of episteme edition, reference scheme, representation scheme, retargeting, or model-use relation. A.6.1 governs a mechanism realization or application binding. State one of these only when its participants and predicate are present; otherwise stop at the source objects without asserting the relation.

Thus *algorithm* and *practice* remain source cues. “The SQL query is the method” fails unless the project can state the reusable way of querying, its admissible inputs, intended result, and stop independently of that query text. “Our review practice is the method” fails when the sentence is actually about a team assignment, dated review, discipline, tradition, evidence record, or publication.

#### A.3.1:4.6 - Constructor and process-theory settlement

When a method concerns change, its statement says what change a future enactment is meant to achieve; it does not assert that any referent changed. The same identification rule applies to methods for other concerns, such as observation, comparison, classification, evaluation, communication, selection, proof, and preservation.

The constructor-theory and process-theory source line supports this separation but does not supply a universal method ontology. FPF uses it as follows:

* An exact actual performer first has the A.13 core; A.15.1 then independently identifies the dated Work, at least one obtaining `enactsMethod` relation, time, and at least one obtaining locally declared containing-system relation. Another enactment relation is named only when the receiving claim relies on it. F.6 enters only when that claim also consumes precise assignment-bound attribution through the same obtaining A.13 assignment; missing or failed F.6 leaves the Work intact. The System's classification and the obtaining assignment remain separate claims.
* The `U.Method` is the reusable way under stated participant meanings, applicability, conditions, intended result or preserved condition, and bounds. A `U.MethodDescription` is an episteme that describes it.
* A formal substrate or mathematical lens can make the method analyzable, and a `U.Mechanism` can declare the relevant operation family and laws.
* A cross-context Bridge, changed reference or model-use relation, mechanism realization, evaluation, or evidence-use claim remains a separately stated relation with its own participants.
* A `U.WorkPlan` prepares or schedules dated Work; a Work individual is the occurrence that actually happened.

For example, “the etch method changed `Wafer-22`” contains at least two claims. A.3.1 identifies the reusable etch method. Only if an actual bounded change of `Wafer-22` is independently grounded does A.3.4 identify that transformation; any claim connecting the Work and transformation additionally needs its own predicate or a missing-governor result.

Apply the same distinction across physical, informational, organizational, and mathematical work.

#### A.3.1:4.7 - Semantic identity and variants

Two `U.MethodDescription` epistemes describe the same `U.Method` when their EntityOfConcern references resolve to the same A.3.1 identity. For the proposed comparison or reuse, compare their claims about the following method bases separately:

* effective reference scheme and local senses, when a meaning difference matters;
* generic participant meanings and declared applicability;
* compatible preconditions;
* compatible intended effects or preserved conditions;
* compatible safety and other non-functional bounds;
* accepted nondeterminism or search behavior; and
* the same work-facing acceptance relation, when that relation is part of the comparison.

Different control flow, proof notation, programming paradigm, diagram notation, or prose does not by itself make a different method. The converse also holds: the same name, repository, supplier label, or diagram family does not prove identity.

Keep one method across parameter ranges, equipment envelopes, or representation variants only when its declared applicability and the bases used by the comparison admit that variation. A changed intended result, participant meaning, safety bound, semantic basis, or acceptance criterion requires a stated refinement, substitution, or distinct-method decision.

**Same-name locality replay.** An emergency-department `Triage` method applies to patient presentations awaiting clinical assessment; a clinician enacting it uses clinical signs to assign urgency, escalates unsafe cases, and stops when the evidence cannot support that assignment. A software-defect `Triage` method applies to defect reports awaiting product handling; a product team enacting it uses reproduction evidence, severity, and ownership to choose routing and release impact, and stops when the report cannot support that choice. The shared label identifies neither method. Their participants, applicability, local senses, intended results, and stops distinguish them without a generic context object.

**No-extra-locality replay.** `EuclideanGCD` over positive integers closes as one method when the integer meanings, division-with-remainder rule, positivity precondition, decreasing-remainder invariant, and greatest-common-divisor result are stated. If those facts answer the comparison, add no claim scope, context slice, model-use structure, or other locality object.

#### A.3.1:4.8 - Method relations, composition, and Work enactment

Start with the practical question, not a graph or the umbrella word *specialization*. Ask what must be decided now.

| Current question | First useful result |
| --- | --- |
| Does this reusable way meet one or more Method-kind criteria? | Use `C.3.2` for the admissibility check and a `true`, `false`, or `unknown` judgment. An out-of-scope request is `not-applicable` and forms no judgment. |
| Does one Method kind have several broader kinds? | Check each broader-kind claim under `C.3.1`. |
| Does one Method contribute to several larger Methods? | Use `B.1.5` for every part–whole pair and every whole construction. Each whole keeps its own action, boundary, interfaces, and reidentification rule. |
| Are two Methods being compared for refinement or replacement? | First identify both Methods and the use that needs the comparison. State the direction, what remains, what changes, and the material guards or losses. A sentence or local claim is often enough for one use. |
| Is this another question—for example, parameter variation, family grouping, fallback, dispatch, a description, a selected structure, performed Work, capability, provider contribution, or cultural change? | Use the pattern that defines or tests that claim. The label alone establishes no Method kind, Method part, or relation occurrence. |

Before claiming refinement or replacement, decide whether the changed account still identifies the same Method. If it does, state what was preserved and what changed; do not invent a relation between two Methods. If two Methods are identified, a refinement comparison states its direction and use, the semantics retained from the first Method, what the second narrows or strengthens, and the action or result that changes.

A replacement comparison says which Method may replace which other Method, for what use, under which preconditions, with which intended result or preserved condition, and which bounds, interfaces, losses, and guards must remain visible. Do not infer the reverse direction. Shared kind criteria or similar descriptions do not prove replacement.

A parameter change inside the Method's declared applicability and identity rule is variation of the same Method. A change to a participant meaning, result, bound, interface, or acceptance condition that matters to identity identifies another Method or leaves the identity question unresolved.

A `G.5` family row cites already identified Methods and states why they are grouped for the current use. A fallback can belong to a `B.1.5` whole construction, a `G.5` selector rule or result, or a local relation-bearing claim. A dispatch rule says which selector branch applies; state the current branch and its basis.

When FPF has no admitted predicate for refinement, replacement, fallback, or another relation-bearing claim, use `A.6.RCD` to choose the lightest sufficient result. For one use, a local claim may be enough; repeated use of the same rule may justify a reusable predicate definition. Continue through `E.24` and `E.24.UK` only when a named later use must treat the relation occurrences themselves as stable objects. A local claim or predicate definition cannot become an `A.22` edge.

**Short positive.** `ChangeImpactReview` can meet two Method-kind criteria and also be required by the independent constructions of `ApproveControlSoftwareRelease` and `InvestigateFieldIncident`. Those judgments and two `methodPartOf` facts remain separate.

**Selector anti-case.** A `RapidRecoveryMethods` row groups `RollbackRelease`, `DisableFeatureFlag`, and `ShiftTraffic` for one selector. Its stated grouping basis and fallback policy may support a `G.5` result, but they do not establish a Method kind, one composite Method, or a refinement or replacement relation. If the fallback condition is incomplete, return the missing fact instead of drawing an edge.

`MethodRelationStructure` is only a local name for an `A.22` structure selected from independently identified constituents and relations that already obtain. It is not a durable kind, Method holon, or relation type. Composition, refinement, replacement, parameter variation, family grouping, fallback, dispatch, and enactment are recognition cues; the cue does not decide the claim.

**Filled A.22 basis — enacted-method review.** For this one-off review, a practitioner selects only two A.15.1 `enactsMethod` occurrences.

* **Independently identified constituents.** `InspectPumpSeal@PumpMaintenance-2026` and `ClassifyPumpSealCondition@PumpMaintenance-2026` are two `U.Method` values. `Pump37SealInspectionWork-2026-07-25T0900-0908` and `Pump37SealClassificationWork-2026-07-25T0910-0916` are two admitted A.15.1 Work occurrences.

  `PumpDiagnosticAssignment` is a declared `U.SystemRoleAssignment` species. Under A.2.1 it defines the holder and assigned-kind participant meanings and uses `PumpDiagnosticSystemRoleKindDomain` as the local assigned-kind domain. Occurrence `Pump37DiagnosticAssignment-2026-07-25` has `PumpDiagnosticService-A : U.System` as holder, `PumpDiagnosticSystemRole` as the assigned-kind value admitted by that domain, and an extent covering both Work occurrences. That System performs each Work under the assignment and within `Pump37MaintenanceCell-A`.


* **Selected obtaining relations.** `enactsMethod(Pump37SealInspectionWork-2026-07-25T0900-0908, InspectPumpSeal@PumpMaintenance-2026)` and `enactsMethod(Pump37SealClassificationWork-2026-07-25T0910-0916, ClassifyPumpSealCondition@PumpMaintenance-2026)` obtain under A.15.1.
* **Applied constraint claims.** `DiagnosticReviewWindowConstraint` states that an eligible `enactsMethod` occurrence must have one of the two independently admitted Work individuals as its Work participant, and that Work's temporal extent must lie within 09:00-09:20 on 2026-07-25. `NoCompositionFromEnactmentOrderConstraint` states that their timestamps and order establish no serial, fallback, or whole-method relation.
* **Selection-use frame.** `DiagnosticMethodEnactmentFrame` states the question: which methods did these two Work occurrences enact during the review window? The admissible action is to list the two `enactsMethod` occurrences in that review.

Those four discriminators identify `DiagnosticMethodEnactmentStructure-2026-07-25-0900-0920`, locally designated `MethodRelationStructure` for this use. Reidentify it only from its four constituents, two obtaining relations, two applied constraint claims, and use frame. If the project relies on a persisted selection, separately identify the System that made it, the selection Method and dated Work, the participation relation or A.6.1 binding used by that Work, and the C.2.1 result episteme. Add a C.11 choice claim only if one is asserted. If responsibility for that choice is also claimed, cite its direct domain predicate, actual participants, applicability, and occurrence identity or return the exact missing governor.

**Missing-governor stop.** Suppose a note additionally calls `ClassifyPumpSealCondition@PumpMaintenance-2026` a fallback for `InspectPumpSeal@PumpMaintenance-2026`, but supplies no direct fallback predicate, compatible participant meanings, or occurrence-identity rule. Keep the two methods and the note, omit the fallback relation, and return `missing-governor: fallback relation for <ClassifyPumpSealCondition@PumpMaintenance-2026, InspectPumpSeal@PumpMaintenance-2026>`. If the question is specifically about fallback organization, do not select a positive structure until that relation and all four A.22 discriminators are available.

Method-holon composition is not A.14 component mereology. Source labels such as `SerialStepOf` or `ParallelFactorOf` remain cues until B.1.5 or another subject pattern supplies an admitted relation with participants and an obtaining rule. A method-description node is not a submethod unless the described object is independently identified as a `U.Method`.

Work composition is occurrence-side. Work may interleave, split, retry, or fail differently from the method description. A temporal Work part can enact the same whole method, and an episode can change Work continuity without changing method identity. Call a candidate a submethod only when it has its own reusable action, preconditions, intended result or preserved condition, boundary, and whole-method relation.

**Quick distinction.** A step label, graph node, detector component, event-log segment, telemetry interval, work-plan item, or document section is not a submethod by position. If it states a reusable way with method-level conditions and a relation to the whole method, test it under A.3.1 and B.1.5. If it states what happened, when it happened, what a component did, or what a record shows, use the direct Work, mechanism, evidence, or description pattern instead.

Mathematical or graphical notation may describe the selected structure under C.29 or occur in a `U.MethodDescription`. A registry row lists or describes candidates; state any relation among them separately under its defining pattern.

### A.3.1:5 - Archetypal Grounding

Across the slices below, recognize a `U.Method` by a stable project answer to this question:

```text
For these kinds of participants and conditions, what reusable way should a future enactment follow; what should it observe, compare, classify, decide, derive, change, produce, control, or preserve; what result or preserved condition is intended; and when should it stop?
```

**Non-transformative method replay.** `DuplicateDefectReportComparison` applies to two defect reports for the same product and release when both contain the required symptom and version data. An evaluator enacting it compares those fields and records `same incident`, `different incidents`, or `insufficient information`; missing version data is a stop. These facts identify the reusable comparison method.

**Actual-transformation branch.** The filled `Etch_Al2O3` replay in 5.1 closes the reusable method without actual-change facts. If a later assertion says that `Wafer-22` changed during Work `W-143`, identify the Work under A.15.1 and the actual transformation of `Wafer-22` under A.3.4 separately; connect them only through a declared predicate or return `missing-governor[work-to-change]`.

Manufacturing, optimization, proof, graph or query overread, and clinical triage differ in material, representation, and assurance needs, but they share the same method-identification question. The archetypal failure is also shared: a nearby description, plan, run, mechanism, formalism, or evidence relation takes the method name and silently changes what the project can rely on.

#### A.3.1:5.1 - Manufacturing recipe

**Situation.** A fab process engineer must decide whether two current SOP editions describe the same alumina-etch method before either description is cited in a work plan. The engineer needs a reusable method identification.

**Reusable way and applicability.** `Etch_Al2O3` applies to alumina-coated silicon wafers whose substrate class and coating range satisfy `RecipeWindow-Al2O3-3`, using a qualified `PE-4` plasma-etcher family and the gas-mixture range declared by that window. Its generic participants are the wafer surface, qualified etcher, admitted gas mixture, and target-depth parameter. A future enactment holds the admitted pressure and temperature envelopes, adjusts exposure until the declared target-depth stop, and preserves the substrate and maximum-temperature conditions.

**Preconditions and stop.** The method is applicable only when the wafer material and coating range are known, the selected `PE-4` calibration is current for the planned use, the admitted gas mixture is available, and the safety interlocks required by `RecipeWindow-Al2O3-3` are part of the intended setup. If the recipe fails to state the material/coating range, calibration requirement, gas mixture, target-depth stop, or preservation limits needed to identify the way, keep `alumina etch` as a method cue until that meaning is recovered. If a particular wafer or setup fails the stated range or calibration requirement, retain the identified Method and stop that planned use under its applicable admission or gate rule.

**Visible identification result.** Under effective `FabProcessScheme-2026`, where `Al2O3`, `target depth`, and `substrate preservation` have the local senses used above, the engineer can write:

```text
MethodRef: Etch_Al2O3
SemanticBasisIfMeaningVaries: FabProcessScheme-2026 (`Al2O3`, `target depth`, and `substrate preservation`)
Applicability: alumina-coated silicon wafer; RecipeWindow-Al2O3-3; qualified PE-4 family
GenericParticipantMeanings: wafer surface; qualified etcher; admitted gas mixture; target-depth parameter
MethodConcern: remove the admitted alumina layer to the declared target-depth stop
Preconditions: material and coating range known; calibration current; gas and safety setup available
IntendedResultOrPreservedCondition: target depth reached; substrate and maximum-temperature bounds preserved
```

This result lets the engineer compare the two SOP claim sets against one method identity and lets a later work plan cite that method and the selected description edition. The SOP, PLC program, calibration recipe, and supplier note remain `U.MethodDescription` candidates when A.3.2 identifies what each episteme describes (`EntityOfConcern`) and the substantive claims it carries. For later work authorization or claims that Work `W-143` occurred or `Wafer-22` changed or passed metrology, use the relevant A.15.2, A.15.1, A.3.4, measurement, evidence, assurance, or gate pattern.

#### A.3.1:5.2 - Optimization model

**Situation and reusable way.** `JS_Schedule_v4` applies when the jobs, eligible machines, durations, precedence constraints, feasibility rules, and optimization objective are all stated for the scheduling problem. A planner or solver system enacting it constructs candidate assignments, rejects infeasible candidates, compares the remainder by the declared objective, and records the selected schedule or `no feasible schedule`. Missing precedence data, an unstated objective, or incompatible machine eligibility is a stop rather than permission to guess a method variant.

This identification lets a planner compare two solver packages as descriptions of the same scheduling method. The MILP formulation and solver configuration are `U.MethodDescription` or formal-substrate candidates according to the claim. The selected production schedule is a `U.WorkPlan`; the dated solver run is Work; and its decision record is a separate result episteme.

#### A.3.1:5.3 - Proof or derivation

`Gauss_Elimination` applies to a matrix and right-hand side over a declared algebraic domain in which the required row operations and pivots are valid. A mathematician or proof system enacting it applies equivalence-preserving row operations until solved or echelon form is reached. A missing admissible pivot, unsupported division, or unspecified domain is a stop. The visible result here is a method identification that a later derivation may enact.

Recover the claim-bearing episteme expressed by a textbook explanation, proof-assistant script, or formal rule set; apply A.3.2's membership test for `Gauss_Elimination`. A concrete proof-assistant run is Work, and the algebraic structure may be a formal substrate. Using the resulting proof for a project decision additionally needs an evidence or assurance relation.

#### A.3.1:5.4 - Graph or query overread

A graph path, SQL query, checklist predicate, or dashboard table may itself be the current direct object or may represent a relation, state, evidence structure, provenance structure, or publication face. It supports a method identification only when the project can separately state the reusable action, admissible inputs, branch criterion, intended result, and stop. A query text that returns rows is still a description or executable representation until that semantic way is stated.

Ordinary wording such as a graph “routes” or a query “calls” is usable when the operation and its participants are recoverable. Apply C.2.P.DR when a representation's form or layout is treated as sufficient to establish method order, dated Work, gate passage, or authority.

#### A.3.1:5.5 - Clinical triage protocol

`SepsisTriage_v3` applies to adult emergency-department presentations inside its declared population and assessment window. A clinician enacting it evaluates the stated signs and measurements, assigns an urgency class, and selects the next clinical response. Insufficient evidence, a patient outside the admitted population, or a presentation requiring another protocol is a stop. The visible result here is the reusable triage method and its boundary.

Recover the claim-bearing episteme expressed by the protocol PDF, order-set screen, or decision-support rule and apply A.3.2's membership test for `SepsisTriage_v3`. Keep its carrier and publication form separate. A clinician's dated assessment is Work. The physiological model or score formula may be a formal substrate or mathematical lens. Admission policy, treatment release, and evidence that triage reduced harm remain neighboring claims under their own patterns.

### A.3.1:6 - Bias-Annotation

This pattern mainly blocks seven recurring biases:

* **description-as-method bias**: a publication, program, diagram, or protocol is treated as the method instead of a method description;
* **practice-as-method bias**: a source says "practice" and the repair silently chooses `U.Method` without checking whether the current claim is Work, system-role assignment, discipline, cultural-evolution, evidence, source label, or Method relation structure;
* **run-as-method bias**: a trace, log, run, or result record is treated as the reusable way of doing;
* **software-notation bias**: code, algorithm, workflow, or programming-paradigm language becomes the default ontology for every method;
* **mechanism-overread bias**: law-governed mechanism or formal-substrate material is treated as if it already selected the project method;
* **holder-as-method bias**: a team, system, supplier, or capability holder becomes the method name;
* **semio-bias**: the discussion shifts to wording, a document, publication, or evidence face before the reusable action and its boundary have been stated.

Use one concrete test in every case: can the reader state the reusable action, its participants, applicability, intended result, and stop? If yes, identify the `U.Method`; apply A.3.2 separately to each candidate `U.MethodDescription` episteme; handle any plan under A.15.2; and state only those enactment, evidence, or other relations that actually obtain. If not, keep the source phrase unresolved or use the subject pattern shown in §4.

### A.3.1:7 - Conformance Checklist

**CC-A3.1-1 (Method identity).** `U.Method` is one reusable way of doing under a stated concern, participant meanings, applicability, preconditions, intended result or preserved condition, and bounds. If the sentence also makes a claim about an actual participant, A.3.4 transformation, description, plan, dated Work occurrence, evidence relation, system-role assignment, capability, mechanism declaration, formal declaration, publication face, or pattern relation, write that claim under its direct pattern and state only the relation to the Method that actually obtains.

**CC-A3.1-2 (Semantic locality).** State the applicability, participant meanings, conditions, intended result, and bounds that distinguish the method. Add an effective reference scheme and local senses only when different meanings would change the identification. Add a claim scope, context slice, selected structure, or model-use relation only when its predicate obtains and changing that object would change the identification or the stated later decision.

**CC-A3.1-3 (Method-description membership and use).** When work, assurance, gate, or audit reliance depends on a method description, name the exact episteme and verify that it meets A.3.2 membership for this Method. If several epistemes are treated as descriptions of the same Method, their `EntityOfConcern` references must resolve to the same A.3.1 identity; compare their claim sets separately for the proposed use.

**CC-A3.1-4 (Assignment-free Method).** A Method may state local system-role-kind admission conditions or capability-fit conditions. These are Method-side admissibility conditions, not deontic obligations by default. The Method does not bind named people, teams, organizations, or calendar allocations.

**CC-A3.1-5 (Runtime-free method).** A dated run is a Work individual under `U.Work`, not a method field. Recover each exact actual performer and its obtaining system-role assignment through A.13; A.15.1 independently grounds the Work, enacted Method, extent, containing System, and every participation or resource relation used by the claim. Add F.6 attribution through that same assignment only when the receiving use expressly represents precise assignment-bound attribution. Telemetry, logs, measurements, evaluations, production, delivery, acceptance, and result records remain separate claims.

**CC-A3.1-6 (Plan-free method).** Work preparation, schedule, go or no-go date, work authorization, and planned work relation belong to `U.WorkPlan`, gate, authority, or commitment patterns.

**CC-A3.1-7 (Mechanism and formal-substrate separation).** A formal substrate, mathematical lens, mechanism declaration, realizer, or control model can constrain or help explain a method only through a relation with stated participants. Use `E.10.ARCH:3.1` to classify that neighboring claim. It does not identify the method until the reusable action, applicability, intended result, and boundary are stated.

**CC-A3.1-8 (Programming-paradigm neutrality).** Imperative, functional, logical, constraint, object-centric event, effect-handler, and hybrid forms remain descriptions or representations until the reusable way and its boundary are stated.

**CC-A3.1-9 (Graph and representation guard).** A graph path, path slice, query, predicate, table, dashboard, publication face, or pattern relation is not a method or work sequence by layout. Use `C.2.P.DR` when representation wording is overread as imperative action.

**CC-A3.1-10 (Method parts, structures, and Work parts).** Call a candidate a submethod only when its reusable action, preconditions, intended result or preserved condition, boundary, and relation to the whole method are stated. Otherwise keep the step, graph node, description fragment, Work part, episode, component behavior, or telemetry slice under its own pattern. A selected method-side `U.Structure` must have all four A.22 discriminators; layout and list membership establish none of them. Mathematical or graphical notation remains a description or C.29 representation.

**CC-A3.1-11 (Practice wording recovery).** For a source word such as *practice*, ask what the sentence lets the reader do: reuse a way, inspect a description, schedule or report Work, allocate a holder, classify a discipline or tradition, cite evidence, or merely quote a label. Choose the corresponding subject pattern only when that action is stated; otherwise retain an unresolved source cue.

**CC-A3.1-12 (Parameter and variant discipline).** Parameters may be method semantics or content of a `U.MethodDescription`. A `U.WorkPlan` may name planned values only against the declaration that gives those values their meaning. An actual value or participant requires an obtaining direct subject relation or A.6.1 application binding. Effects, bounds, participant meanings, applicability, and any semantic basis used by the comparison determine variant identity.

**CC-A3.1-13 (Evidence and assurance boundary).** A method or method description does not by itself prove that work happened, that a result is warranted for the claimed use, that a gate is passed, or that action is authorized. Those claims use the relevant evidence, assurance, gate, temporal, authority, work-plan, or work patterns.

### A.3.1:8 - Common Anti-Patterns and How to Avoid Them

| Anti-pattern | Repair |
| --- | --- |
| Treating executable text as sufficient Method identity. | Recover the claim-bearing episteme expressed by the repository or executable text and apply A.3.2's membership test; if it fails, use the pattern for the actual object. If the claim is about the semantic way of doing, name the `U.Method`, participant meanings, applicability, effects, and bounds. |
| Treating a workflow diagram as the dated Work occurrence. | Recover the claim-bearing episteme expressed by the diagram and apply A.3.2's membership test; if it fails, use the pattern for the actual object. Use `U.WorkPlan` for planned work and one Work occurrence admitted under `U.Work` for the dated occurrence. |
| Inferring prescribed action from graph layout. | Use `E.18` when the sentence is about graph structure and `C.2.P.DR` when layout is being made to prescribe action. If the source actually asserts gate passage or authority, state that separate gate or authority claim. |
| Leaving the optimization-model claim unresolved. | Ask whether the sentence states a formal object, a method description, a reusable way, a work plan, dated Work, or evidence; then keep only that claim in the method position. |
| Inferring safe execution solely from protocol approval. | Separate publication-state claim, gate or authorization claim, evidence claim or assurance claim, work plan, and dated work. |
| Using a team's identity in place of method semantics. | Keep admitted Systems, local system-role kinds, classifications, assignments, and capability claims with their direct patterns; keep participant meanings, applicability, conditions, effects, and bounds with the Method. |

### A.3.1:9 - Consequences

* Method-like language becomes reusable across physical, informational, organizational, and mathematical work without privileging software code or ordered instructions.
* Teams can compare descriptions, variants, and implementations without confusing them with dated work.
* Work planning and evidence become more reliable because a method no longer smuggles in authority, proof, schedule, or performed-work claims.
* The cost is one explicit choice: before relying on method-like wording, say whether the source means a reusable way, its description, planned or performed Work, a mechanism, a representation, or another concrete claim.

#### A.3.1:9.1 - Lowering and local repair conditions

Withdraw a `U.Method` identification when the text cannot answer the ordinary method question: what reusable action is meant, for which participant kinds and conditions, with what intended result or preserved condition, and where it stops. Also withdraw it when the supposed method is only a document, repository, diagram, model, run log, team, supplier label, or authorization; when one value is called both method and mechanism without a governing dual-typing rule; or when a graph or table is being read as an execution order without C.2.P.DR recovery.

Keep a source word such as *practice* unresolved when the sentence does not reveal whether it means a reusable way, a description, planned or performed Work, an assignment, a discipline or tradition, evidence, or a quoted label. Do not force one of those meanings merely to complete the form.

Repair locally:

* If the reusable way is recoverable, rewrite its identification with the missing applicability, participant meaning, condition, result, or stop.
* If a description, plan, Work occurrence, mechanism, representation, evidence claim, or result has occupied the method position, handle that claim under its subject pattern. State a relation back to the method only if that pattern defines it and the current facts satisfy it; otherwise keep the two objects separate.
* If a relied-on episteme no longer meets A.3.2 membership, or its cited edition, claim set, acceptance relation, semantic basis, or variant condition changed, review that changed basis and the comparisons that used it; do not invalidate every use of the method.

A new method-description edition changes the method only when it changes a method basis that the comparison relied on. A changed Work fact, measurement, evaluation, production, delivery, acceptance, or evidence result repairs that neighboring claim, not the reusable method by default. Use G.5 or the direct method-family pattern only when the available family or selector no longer separates the needed methods and variants. Poor explanation is a didactic defect to repair; it is not evidence that the method itself changed.

### A.3.1:10 - Rationale

FPF needs `U.Method` because practical work often depends on a way of doing before there is one dated work occurrence, one accepted description, one final implementation, or one verified result. Treating the method as the document, code, mechanism, plan, or run makes reuse brittle: changing the publication looks like changing the method, a run error looks like method invalidation, and a mechanism claim starts authorizing work.

A method claim states the reusable way of doing, participant meanings, applicability, conditions, effects, and bounds. The mechanism episteme declares a law-governed operation family, its subject and range fields, operation algebra, laws, admissibility predicates, and Applicability. A Bridge, realization, evaluation, or evidence-use claim may relate to that episteme without entering its semantic content. The method and mechanism may be linked, but they are not two names for one untyped value.

### A.3.1:11 - SoTA-Echoing

Adapt it beyond physical tasks: an FPF method states a reusable way of addressing a declared concern, with generic participant meanings, applicability, conditions, intended effects, and bounds, without asserting an actual A.3.4 transformation. A concrete realizer is connected to a mechanism declaration by a separate realization relation; any actual changed referent and change occurrence belong to A.3.4, and dated enactment belongs to work. The 2023 paper is a formal bridge and the 2026 paper is a current extension, not evidence that constructor theory alone supplies a universal method ontology. | The pattern starts from the method concern and separates method, actual transformation, mechanism, mechanism realization, description, plan, and work. In the manufacturing case, equipment equations and one tool run do not identify the reusable Method or prove an actual change. |
| Scoped effects, handlers, and current semantic non-uniqueness | Bosman, van den Berg, Tang, and Schrijvers, ["A Calculus for Scoped Effects & Handlers"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.09697), LMCS 20(4), 2024; Matache, Lindley, Moss, Staton, Wu, and Yang, ["Scoped Effects as Parameterized Algebraic Theories"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03103), ESOP 2024 extended version; Kura, ["On Complete Categorical Semantics for Effect Handlers"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03275), current 2026 preprint. | Adopt the separation among operation syntax, handling semantics, scope, resources, equations, and type-and-effect information. Kura's result strengthens the guard: even a sound formal account need not be the only semantic model of the same handling constructs. Adapt only as a software-derived stress test; these calculi do not define methods in manufacturing, medicine, or organizational work. | The pattern refuses to repair `algorithm`, `program`, `function`, handler syntax, or one semantic model to `U.Method` merely by programming-paradigm label. The proof and optimization cases ask for the bounded way of doing before admitting a method identity. |
| Current graph, binding, and persistent-equivalence representations | Tiurin, Barrett, Ghica, and Hu, ["Equivalence Hypergraphs: DPO Rewriting for Monoidal E-Graphs"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15882), revised 2025-05-20; Tiurin, Ghica, and Hu, ["Categorical E-Graphs for Lambda Calculi"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00807), revised 2026-06-25; Merckx et al., ["E-Graphs as a Persistent Compiler Abstraction"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16707), current 2026 preprint. | Adapt the demonstrated distinction between represented equivalence or rewriting structure and an ordered instruction sequence. Binding-aware hierarchical hypergraphs and equivalence state preserved across several intermediate-representation levels show why neither graph layout nor one representation level establishes the semantic method or dated work order. These sources are compiler and formal-representation results, not a general ontology of project methods. | Graph paths, queries, tables, rewrite graphs, and persistent compiler structures remain descriptions or formal lenses until a direct method, method-relation, work, evidence, or gate claim is recovered.

| Historical declarative versus imperative programming contrasts | Codd 1970; Kowalski 1979; Selinger et al. 1979; van der Aalst, Pesic, and Schonenberg 2009; Van Roy and Haridi 2004; Deutsch 2013; Deutsch and Marletto 2015. | Reject as current SoTA; retain only as lineage and regression contrast. | Treat slogans such as *declarative versus imperative* as recognition cues. Ask what the source phrase actually names—a reusable way, description, formal object, or dated Work—before assigning an FPF value. |

Review a project's `U.Method` identification when a change in participant meaning, applicability, precondition, intended result, preserved condition, safety bound, effective scheme, selected structure, model-use relation, or work-facing acceptance criterion could make a reader identify a different method or allow a different case. If only a description edition, Work occurrence, transformation, representation, measurement, or evidence relation changed, review that neighboring claim unless the change also alters one of those method bases.

Use G.11 when a later decision depends on the freshness or edition of a cited method description or source. A newer paper, implementation, or run is a reason to inspect the relation that cites it, not automatic evidence of a new method.

### A.3.1:12 - Relations

* **Identity and meaning:** builds on `A.1`, `A.2`, `A.2.1`, `A.2.2`, and `C.2.1`; use `F.17` when a local sense matters and `G.11` when a comparison relies on source or edition currentness.
* **Description, composition, and variation:** coordinates with `A.3.2` for method descriptions, `A.3.3` for dynamics, `B.1.5` for order-sensitive method composition, `B.2` for whole reidentification, and `G.5` for method families and selector outcomes.
* **Work and change:** coordinates with `A.15.2` for plans, `A.15.1` for dated Work, and `A.3.4` only after an actual changed referent and Transformation are independently claimed. Local system-role kinds, assignments, and relations among exact system-role kinds remain under `A.2`, `A.2.1`, and `A.2.7`.
* **Mechanism and representation:** coordinates with `A.6.0` for formal declarations, `A.6.1` and `E.20` for mechanisms, `C.29` for mathematical-lens use, `F.9` for sense Bridges, and `A.1.1` only for an obtaining model-use relation or selected `BoundedModelUseStructure` that changes the method decision.
* **Source-wording exits:** coordinates with `C.20`, `C.36`, and `C.36.P` for discipline and cultural-evolution uses of *practice*; `A.10` for evidence and provenance; and `C.2.P.DR` for representations overread as routes or Work sequences.
* **Informs:** `E.18` and `E.18.1` when flow-structure or P2W wording must keep descriptions, mathematical paths, method claims, and Work claims separate.

### A.3.1:End
