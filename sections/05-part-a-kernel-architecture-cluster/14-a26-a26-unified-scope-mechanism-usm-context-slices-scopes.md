## A.2.6 - Unified Scope Mechanism (USM): Context Slices & Scopes
> **Status:** Stable
> **Type:** Ontic pattern


### A.2.6:0.1 - Kind Settlement

`U.ContextSlice` and `U.Scope` are the durable USM values for scope work. `U.ClaimScope`, `U.WorkScope`, and `U.PublicationScope` are C.3-governed scope specializations under `U.Scope`, not independent root ontics. `ContextSliceSet := Set[U.ContextSlice]` is the mathematical ValueKind whose values are exact sets of independently identified context slices; it is neither a durable scope nor another U-kind. Each exact `U.Scope` has one `ContextSliceSet` value as its extension under the effective reference scheme.

> **One-line summary.** A.2.6 lets a practitioner test one exact `U.ContextSlice` against one exact set-valued scope. For a claim, `member(slice, claimScope)` is `true` or `false`: `true` admits the claim-scope condition and `false` stops that use. An evaluation returns `unknown` when its available basis cannot determine membership. The predicate is not a `U.Relation` occurrence.

**Use this pattern when** a receiving action needs to decide whether a claim, capability, or publication use covers one exact combination of standards, environment, local sense, platform, cohort, or time selectors.

**First useful move.** Name the exact claim, its exact `U.ClaimScope`, and the target `U.ContextSlice`; evaluate membership. Stop on `false`. On `unknown`, obtain the missing evaluation input, narrow the attempted use, or abstain. Add a result episteme or table only when the receiving use needs one. If exact local senses must be translated, first name the obtaining F.9 Bridge, then state the separate affirmative C.2.1 claim for this translation's direction, rule, and tolerance. Before using the translated scope, establish evidence-based reliance through A.10 or assurance-based reliance through B.3.

**What goes wrong if missed.** Teams infer coverage from a document, table, “current context” label, or selected structure; treat an unevaluated slice as excluded; or mint `ScopeDelimitationRelation` occurrences for included and excluded slices. Those moves collapse predicate truth, evaluation, representation, and structure.

**What this buys.** One set-valued scope algebra supports exact membership, intersection, supported union, translation, widening, narrowing, and refit while keeping claim content, evaluation work, result epistemes, model-applicability relations, and selected structures separate.
**Vocabulary boundary.** Use these scope names in live FPF wording:


* For epistemes, the only **scope type** is **`U.ClaimScope`** (nick **G** in F–G–R).
* For system capabilities, the only **scope type** is **`U.WorkScope`**.
* For publication views or forms, the only **scope type** is **`U.PublicationScope`**.
* The abstract architectural notion is **`U.Scope`** — a durable scope value identified extensionally through one exact `ContextSliceSet` value under the effective reference scheme. Intersection, SpanUnion, translation, widening, and narrowing operate on those extensions; refit changes an expression without changing the extension. `U.Scope` is **not** a `U.Characteristic` and MUST NOT appear in any `CharacteristicSpace`.

Source words such as *applicability*, *envelope*, *generality*, and *capability envelope* may appear only as explanatory aliases in non-normative notes.

**Cross‑references.**
- **C.2.3** (Unified Formality **F**) and **C.2.2** (F–G–R): this pattern **defines G** as `U.ClaimScope`.
- **A.2.2** (Capabilities): capability gating **SHALL** use `U.WorkScope`.
- **F.9** (Bridges): use an exact obtaining Bridge only when membership content must be translated across exact local senses; a different label or reference scheme alone does not trigger translation. F.9 supplies the direct semantic relation only. The separate C.2.1 claim states the exact translation use, direction, rule, tolerance, and polarity; A.10 or B.3 governs reliance on that claim.
- **Part E** (Publication discipline; e.g., **E.17 MVPK**): publication views, cards, and lanes MAY declare `U.PublicationScope` to bound **where** a publication is admissible; `U.PublicationScope` MUST NOT widen the underlying `U.ClaimScope`/`U.WorkScope`. (USM supplies the scope calculus; Part E supplies publication discipline.)

### A.2.6:1 - Problem frame - Purpose and Audience

This pattern gives practitioners one exact question: *does this slice belong to the scope needed by this use?* It applies first to claim scope and reuses the same value algebra for work and publication scopes.

The claim-bearing episteme, capability, or publication object designates or uses an exact `U.ClaimScope`, `U.WorkScope`, or `U.PublicationScope`. The membership predicate, evaluation work, result episteme, gate, and evidence claim also remain separate.

With USM, a practitioner can:

* declare exact slice selectors and an exact scope predicate;
* evaluate membership as true, false, or currently unknown;
* combine exact scopes by intersection or independently supported union;
* translate only when exact local senses require an obtaining F.9 Bridge, a separate affirmative C.2.1 claim about this translation, and the current A.10 or B.3 reliance branch.

A.2.6 defines the scope values, membership predicate, mathematical scope algebra, exact reusable A.6.1 operation declarations, and use boundaries. Use A.15.1 for evaluation work, A.10 for evidence, A.21 for gate decisions, and A.22 for structure selection. The practitioner decides whether and which claim to widen for the receiving use.

### A.2.6:2 - Context

#### A.2.6:2.1 - Cross‑disciplinary pressures

Modern projects couple **formal specs**, **data‑driven models**, **safety cases**, and **operational playbooks**. Each specification, model, safety case, or operational-playbook publication must say **where it is valid**—yet terminology drifts:

* Standards and specs often say *applicability* or *scope*.
* Modeling communities say *envelope*.
* Safety and performance documents speak about *capability envelope*.
* Knowledge patterns have used *generality* (G) as if it were “more abstract,” when we actually need “**where the statement holds**.”

#### A.2.6:2.2 - Slice-bounded reasoning

`U.ContextSlice` is an addressable value identified by its exact declared selector schema and selector values under the effective reference scheme: for example local senses, named standard editions, environmental values, platform or cohort selectors, and a time selector when that selector belongs to the declared schema. One scope predicate may inspect only a projection of those selectors, but that projection does not reidentify the slice.

The practical question is therefore concrete: *does this exact slice belong to this exact scope?* A phrase such as “inside the current context,” a project label, or a selected `U.Structure` does not answer it.

#### A.2.6:2.3 - Minimal, composable trust math

In **F–G–R**:

* **F** (formality) is “how strictly a claim is expressed” (C.2.3).
* **G** must be “**where it holds**,” not “how abstract it sounds.”
* **R** carries evidence and reliance currentness. Observed semantic mismatch or loss may be evidence about a proposed translation, while the permitted-loss tolerance belongs to the separate C.2.1 claim about that use.

When **G** is a **set‑valued scope**, composition becomes precise: serial dependencies **intersect** scopes; parallel, independently supported lines can publish a **SpanUnion**—but only where each line is supported.

### A.2.6:3 - Problem

1. **Synonym soup.** *Applicability, envelope, generality, capability envelope*—different labels for the **same mechanism** led to mismatches in gating, review, and reuse.
2. **Abstraction confusion.** Calling G “generality” invited teams to treat “more abstract wording” as “broader scope,” silently masking unstated assumptions.
3. **Split mechanics.** Episteme vs system text used different algebra and guard language, though **the same set operations** were meant.
4. **Translation opacity.** Exact local-sense translation was confused with ordinary designation resolution, causing automatic Bridge use and hidden changes to the supported slice set.
5. **Overloaded words.** *Validity* clashed with **Validation Assurance (LA)**; *operation* and *operational* clashed with **Work** and **Run** in A.15, producing governance ambiguity.

### A.2.6:4 - Forces

| Force                                             | Tension to resolve                                                                                                                                               |
| ------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **One mechanism vs two worlds**                   | We must serve both **knowledge about the world** (claims) and **doing work in the world** (capabilities) **without** duplicating concepts.                       |
| **Exact local interpretation vs interoperability** | Scope membership must stay checkable under its effective reference scheme. Cross-scheme translation needs an obtaining F.9 Bridge for the direct semantic relation, a separate C.2.1 claim for the proposed translation, and current A.10 or B.3 reliance, without redefining membership truth. |
| **Expressivity vs minimal vocabulary**            | Teams need to capture rich conditions (time windows, environment, versions) but not explode the lexicon into variants such as “envelope”, “applicability”, or “generality”.                |
| **Static content vs operational change**          | Claims may hold broadly while current operations are narrow (or vice versa). The mechanism must keep “what is true” and “what can be done” aligned yet distinct. |
| **Open‑world exploration vs closed‑world gating** | Exploration benefits from permissive drafts; **gates** require crisp, observable checks. The same scope object must support both.                                |

### A.2.6:5 - Solution - Overview

USM keeps the following things distinct:

* **`U.ContextSlice`** - one addressable value identified independently of the predicate that later inspects it;
* **`ContextSliceSet`** - the mathematical ValueKind `Set[U.ContextSlice]`, used for scope extensions and finite target sets;
* **`U.Scope`** - one durable scope value whose extension is one exact `ContextSliceSet` value;
* **`U.ClaimScope`**, **`U.WorkScope`**, and **`U.PublicationScope`** - C.3 specializations for claim, capability, and publication uses;
* **membership semantics, mathematical scope algebra, and reusable operations** - three separate layers: the bivalent predicate, its C.29 set representations, and the exact A.6.1 declarations used only when a receiving use needs an actual application and binding.

The primitive claim-scope question is `member(x, S)` for exact slice `x` and exact scope `S`. Intersection handles serial dependence. `spanUnion` is allowed only for independently supported areas. `widen` and `narrow` change the extension; `refit` preserves it while changing only a scope expression or parameterization. `translate` is used only when exact local-sense content must cross an obtaining F.9 Bridge and a separate affirmative C.2.1 claim names this translation's direction, rule, and tolerance. A receiving guard relies on that claim through a passing A.10 disposition or, when an actual named assurance claim is current, a B.3 `AssuranceResult` for the same use with `disposition=supported-for-use`; a different label or reference scheme alone selects none of these.

One exact `U.ClaimScope` may participate in a `ModelApplicabilityRelation`. That relation, its actual obtaining extent, a selected A.22 structure, a membership evaluation, and a table displaying members remain separate.

**Lexical commitments.** In normative text and guards, use **Claim scope (G)**, **Work scope**, and **Publication scope**. Source words such as *applicability*, *envelope*, *generality*, *capability envelope*, or *validity* may remain only when quoted or explained; they do not name additional scope kinds.

### A.2.6:6 - Normative Definitions

#### A.2.6:6.0 - Predicate semantics, mathematical algebra, and A.6.1 operations

Keep three layers explicit:

1. **Scope semantics.** `member(x,S)` is a bivalent predicate over one exact `U.ContextSlice` and one exact `U.Scope`.
2. **Mathematical representation.** The formulae below represent membership and set operations under C.29. Use the declarations and bindings below for an actual operation application.
3. **Reusable actual operations.** When a receiving use needs one identified calculation or evaluation application and its bound result, use one of the exact A.6.1 `OperationDeclaration`s below. These are argument and result declarations, never A.6.5 SlotSpecs.

**Mathematical semantics.**

```text
member(x, S)                        : Bool
scopeSubset(S1, S2)                 := for every x, member(x,S1) implies member(x,S2)
coversSet(S, T)                     := for every x in T, member(x,S)
extension(intersect(F))             := intersection of extension(S) for S in F
extension(SpanUnion(F))             := union of extension(S) for S in F
extension(translate(B,C_use,S,RS))  := the target-slice image of extension(S) selected by C_use's rule and tolerance over Bridge B under RS
widen(S0,S1)                        := extension(S0) proper-subset extension(S1)
narrow(S0,S1)                       := extension(S1) proper-subset extension(S0)
refit(E0,E1,S)                      := expressions E0 and E1 both designate exact scope S
```

Here `T : ContextSliceSet` is a finite target set, `F : Set[U.Scope]` is a finite scope family, `B` is an exact obtaining F.9 Bridge, `C_use` is the exact current C.2.1 claim with `B` as EntityOfConcern and affirmative polarity for this named scope-translation use, and `RS` is the exact target reference scheme. The claim's content names the direction, scope-correspondence rule, and permitted-loss tolerance used to select the target image; its effective ReferenceScheme makes those designations interpretable. `scopeSubset`, `coversSet`, `widen`, `narrow`, and `refit` are mathematical predicates or comparison classifications, not actual A.6.1 operations. The formula represents the claim's proposed mapping but proves neither the claim nor reliance on it and declares no operation application. Work that authors or compares scope declarations remains separately governed.

**A.6.1 declaration A — `ScopeMembershipEvaluationMechanism`.**

- `EntityOfConcernRef`: exact operation family `ScopeMembershipEvaluationOperationFamily = {evaluateMembership}`.
- effective `U.ReferenceScheme`: the scheme under which this mechanism's argument, result, and application meanings are interpreted.
- `SubjectKind`: `U.Scope`.
- `RangedValueKind`: `U.ContextSlice`.
- `ResultKind`: declaration-local finite `U.Kind` `MembershipEvaluationValue = {true, false, unknown}` under C.3. Its membership rule admits exactly those three values. It is not a world-side third truth value, public U-kind, gate decision, or result episteme.
- `SliceSet` and `ExtentRule`: absent; membership of the kind `U.Scope` is not slice-dependent in the A.6.0 sense.

`OperationDeclaration evaluateMembership`:

| Declaration-local item | Meaning | ValueKind | Binding designation rule | Binding predicate | Cardinality |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| argument `targetSlice` | exact independently identified slice being tested | `U.ContextSlice` | `ByValue` | this application evaluates the bound slice | exactly 1 |
| argument `scope` | exact extensional scope against which membership is tested | `U.Scope` | `ByValue` | this application evaluates against the bound scope | exactly 1 |
| argument `interpretationBasis` | exact separately identified episteme containing the scope expression, available selector resolutions, and any translation input used by this application | `U.Episteme` | `ByGovernedReference` | the reference resolves to the exact basis actually used; citation or availability alone is insufficient | exactly 1 |
| result `membershipJudgment` | what the application could determine about the bivalent predicate | `MembershipEvaluationValue` | `ByValue` | this application returns this value | exactly 1 |

`ApplicationPredicate`: with those bindings, evaluate `member(targetSlice, scope)` under the bound interpretation basis; return `true` or `false` when the basis determines the predicate and `unknown` when a required selector resolution or translation input is unavailable. The application leaves the target slice and scope unchanged.

`ApplicationIdentityRule`: one application is one independently bounded evaluation invocation selected by the current calculation or evaluation-work locus. Repeating the evaluation with the same arguments is another application when another invocation occurs; argument equality alone does not merge them.

`ApplicationExtentRule`: the application begins when its exact argument bindings and interpretation basis are fixed for the invocation and ends when `membershipJudgment` is returned or the invocation stops without a result. A result binding cannot begin before the value is returned.

**`ScopeMembershipEvaluationMechanism` LawSet.** With the same exact argument bindings, interpretation basis, and effective reference scheme, evaluation is deterministic. `true` reports that the basis determines `member(targetSlice, scope)`; `false` reports that it determines non-membership; `unknown` reports only that it cannot determine either result.

**`ScopeMembershipEvaluationMechanism` AdmissibilityConditions.** Admit an application only after the exact slice, exact scope, and exact interpretation basis are bound. `unknown` is admitted when that basis records an unavailable required selector resolution or translation input. A missing exact scope, slice, or basis blocks the application rather than creating a guessed binding.

**`ScopeMembershipEvaluationMechanism` Applicability.** Use this declaration only for evaluating exact `U.ContextSlice` and `U.Scope` values under its effective reference scheme. The receiving use names its exact `U.ClaimScope`, selected evaluation time when current, selected `CHR:ReferencePlane` only when the use is plane-dependent, and any mechanism-specific condition.

**`ScopeMembershipEvaluationMechanism` SignatureManifest (optional).** When dependency replay needs it, name the actual imported or provided declarations for `U.ContextSlice`, `U.Scope`, and the local `MembershipEvaluationValue`.

**`ScopeMembershipEvaluationMechanism` neighboring objects.** An evaluation application can occur within dated work governed by A.15.1. A separately persisted result episteme remains optional under C.2.1; A.15.PROD enters only for a current claim that work first constituted that episteme. Evidence-use and gate occurrences stay under A.10 and A.21. None of those objects, nor another evaluation invocation, reidentifies this mechanism unless it reveals changed declaration content.

**`ScopeMembershipEvaluationMechanism` refinement or conservative extension.** A refinement preserves `evaluateMembership`, its argument and result meanings, binding rules, application predicate, identity and extent, and the bivalent-truth boundary while stating every strengthened law or admission condition. A conservative extension adds exact optional arguments, results, or operations without changing those inherited meanings or admitted uses.

**A.6.1 declaration B — `ScopeDerivationMechanism`.**

- `EntityOfConcernRef`: exact operation family `ScopeDerivationOperationFamily = {deriveIntersectionScope, deriveSpanUnionScope, deriveTranslatedScope}`.
- effective `U.ReferenceScheme`: the scheme under which this mechanism's operation meanings and returned scopes are interpreted.
- `SubjectKind`: `U.Scope`.
- `RangedValueKind`: `U.Scope`; each derivation operation still returns a `U.Scope`, so no distinct mechanism-level `ResultKind` is current.
- `SliceSet` and `ExtentRule`: absent for the same A.6.0 reason stated above.

| Operation | Declaration-local item | Meaning | ValueKind | Binding designation rule | Binding predicate | Cardinality |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `deriveIntersectionScope` | argument `scopeFamily` | exact finite family whose scope extensions are intersected | `Set[U.Scope]` | `ByValue` | this application uses the bound set value, containing at least two exact scopes | exactly 1 set value |
|  | result `derivedScope` | exact extensional scope returned for the intersection | `U.Scope` | `ByValue` | this application returns this independently identifiable scope value | exactly 1 |
| `deriveSpanUnionScope` | argument `scopeFamily` | exact finite family whose independently supported extensions are united by the established `SpanUnion` operation | `Set[U.Scope]` | `ByValue` | this application uses the bound set value, containing at least two exact scopes | exactly 1 set value |
|  | argument `independenceBasis` | exact episteme stating the support lines and their required independence | `U.Episteme` | `ByGovernedReference` | the reference resolves to the exact basis actually used by this application | exactly 1 |
|  | result `derivedScope` | exact extensional scope returned for `SpanUnion(scopeFamily)` | `U.Scope` | `ByValue` | this application returns this independently identifiable scope value | exactly 1 |
| `deriveTranslatedScope` | argument `sourceScope` | exact source scope whose extension is mapped | `U.Scope` | `ByValue` | this application maps the bound scope value | exactly 1 |
|  | argument `bridgeOccurrence` | exact obtaining F.9 Bridge whose direct semantic relation is used | `U.Relation` | `ByGovernedReference` | the reference resolves to the exact obtaining occurrence actually used by this application; it carries no use-specific rule, tolerance, or reliance | exactly 1 |
|  | argument `scopeTranslationClaim` | exact current C.2.1 claim that says the bound Bridge is suitable for this named scope translation | `U.Episteme` | `ByGovernedReference` | the reference resolves to the exact affirmative claim whose EntityOfConcern is the bound Bridge and whose content names this use, direction, rule, and tolerance | exactly 1 |
|  | argument `targetReferenceScheme` | exact scheme under which target slices and their local senses are interpreted | `U.ReferenceScheme` | `ByValue` | this application interprets the returned target-slice extension under the bound scheme | exactly 1 |
|  | result `derivedScope` | exact extensional scope returned for the target image selected by the claim's rule and tolerance | `U.Scope` | `ByValue` | this application returns this independently identifiable scope value | exactly 1 |

**ApplicationPredicate rules.** `deriveIntersectionScope` returns the scope represented under C.29 by `intersection of extension(S) for S in scopeFamily`. `deriveSpanUnionScope` implements the already established `SpanUnion`: it is admitted only when `independenceBasis` establishes the section 7.3 independence condition and returns the scope represented by `SpanUnion(scopeFamily)`. `deriveTranslatedScope` is admitted only when the bound Bridge obtains and the bound C.2.1 claim has that Bridge as EntityOfConcern, affirmative polarity, and content naming this scope-translation use, its direction, rule, and tolerance. The application applies that rule within that tolerance and returns the scope represented by `translate(bridgeOccurrence, scopeTranslationClaim, sourceScope, targetReferenceScheme)`. The formulae and claim alone declare no application or result binding.

For every governed-reference argument, record presence, citation, or a compatible token is insufficient: the reference must resolve to the exact value actually used. For every result row, the result binding obtains only when this application returns the independently identifiable extensional scope.

`ApplicationIdentityRule`: each derivation application is one independently bounded calculation invocation identified through its exact invocation boundary, mechanism edition, and operation designator rather than the argument tuple alone. Repeated calculations with equal arguments remain distinct applications.

`ApplicationExtentRule`: the application begins after every required argument is bound for that invocation and ends when the derived-scope value is returned or the invocation stops without a result. A result-binding extent cannot begin before that scope value is returned.

**`ScopeDerivationMechanism` LawSet.** Serial composition uses intersection. Parallel publication uses the one established `SpanUnion` and preserves only slices supplied by independently supported lines. Translation returns only the target-slice image selected by the bound claim's rule and tolerance over the bound obtaining F.9 Bridge. No derivation operation widens support by itself.

**`ScopeDerivationMechanism` AdmissibilityConditions.** Intersection and `SpanUnion` require at least two exact scopes. `deriveSpanUnionScope` additionally requires the bound independence basis to meet section 7.3. `deriveTranslatedScope` requires both an exact obtaining Bridge and the exact affirmative C.2.1 claim whose named rule and tolerance select the claimed target image. A missing or non-obtaining Bridge or a missing or non-affirmative claim blocks that positive derivation application rather than creating a guessed scope; the latter does not negate an otherwise obtaining Bridge.

**`ScopeDerivationMechanism` Applicability.** Name the exact source scopes and reference schemes required by the selected derivation. For translation, also name the bound Bridge and separate C.2.1 claim. Before a receiving guard, assertion, publication, or structure selection relies on the returned scope, require the exact A.10 evidence-provenance relation for this bounded use. For ordinary reliance, require `RelianceDisposition=pass`. If an actual named assurance claim about that use is current, require its B.3 `AssuranceResult` for the same bounded use with `disposition=supported-for-use`. A direct domain rule may require such a claim, but neither scope translation nor consequence creates it.

A missing or non-affirmative use claim or a non-passing A.10 disposition stops ordinary reliance without changing membership truth or the Bridge. When an actual named assurance claim is current, a B.3 `AssuranceResult` with `disposition=narrowed` supports only its stated narrower use; `abstain`, `evidence-needed`, `reopen`, or `blocked` stops the attempted use. A.10 `pass` or B.3 `supported-for-use` supports only the named use. Neither is legal, policy, or deontic authorization, and neither proves that a derivation application or another receiving object occurred. Any required authorization remains under its direct pattern. The receiving use also names its exact `U.ClaimScope`, selected time when current, selected `CHR:ReferencePlane` only when plane-dependent, and derivation-specific conditions. `GammaTimePolicy` enters only when time changes membership; `ReferencePlane` is absent from ordinary set algebra.

**`ScopeDerivationMechanism` SignatureManifest (optional).** When dependency replay needs it, name the actual imported or provided declarations for `U.Scope` and, for translation, the exact F.9 Bridge declaration and C.2.1 claim identity rules. The independence basis, particular Bridge, and particular scope-translation claim are application arguments, not declaration-manifest entries by adjacency. `scopeTranslationClaim` is only this declaration's argument label; it names no public claim kind. A.10 and B.3 reliance objects remain under their subject patterns rather than becoming a common mechanism signature.

**`ScopeDerivationMechanism` neighboring objects.** A derivation can occur within dated calculation work under A.15.1. Its bound independence-basis episteme, Bridge, and C.2.1 scope-translation claim retain their own identities and direct patterns. The exact A.10 relation and disposition, or the exact B.3 `AssuranceResult` when an actual named assurance claim is current, states whether the use has the needed evidence or assurance support; neither is a mechanism argument or result. The returned `U.Scope` is independently identified by its extension. Evidence, publication, gate, assurance, and any downstream Work, assertion, relation, or publication occurrence remain with their direct patterns. None of those objects, nor another derivation invocation, reidentifies this mechanism unless it reveals changed declaration content.

**`ScopeDerivationMechanism` refinement or conservative extension.** A refinement preserves the inherited derivation operations, argument and result meanings, binding rules, application predicates, identity and extent, and the intersection, `SpanUnion`, and translation semantics while stating every strengthened law or admission condition. A conservative extension adds exact optional arguments, results, or operations without changing those inherited meanings or admitted uses.

**Relation between the declarations.** These are two independently identified `U.Mechanism` epistemes. They coordinate by value: a later `evaluateMembership` application may bind a scope returned by one derivation application. If a receiving claim needs a refinement, extension, equivalence, or other direct relation between exact mechanism editions, state its endpoints, predicate, scope, and preserved and changed content under A.6.1.

#### A.2.6:6.1 - `U.ContextSlice` - exact membership target

`U.ContextSlice` is an addressable durable value formed from one exact declared selector schema and one value for every selector present in that schema. A scope predicate may inspect a declared projection of the slice, but it does not determine the slice's identity. A minimal slice declaration contains:

```text
ContextSlice:
  effectiveReferenceScheme:
  declaredSelectorSchema:
  exactLocalSenseRefs?, when included by that schema:
  standardOrInterfaceEditionRefs?, when included by that schema:
  environmentOrPlatformSelectors?:
  cohortOrJurisdictionSelectors?:
  gammaTime?, when included by that schema:
  otherDeclaredSelectors?:
```

The slice is one value. A finite target is one value of mathematical ValueKind `ContextSliceSet`. Two slice designators resolve to the same `U.ContextSlice` exactly when their declared selector schemas match and every declared selector resolves to the same value under the effective reference scheme. A predicate's current argument projection, missing evaluation input, or receiving action cannot merge or split slice identity.

For example, `slice_A` and `slice_B` may share substrate `Al6061`, temperature `140 °C`, and rig edition `Calib-v3` while carrying different declared cohort selectors. A temperature-only scope predicate can return the same result for both slices, but the slices remain distinct; a cohort-sensitive predicate can distinguish them without reidentifying either one.

Do not write an implicit “current” or “latest” selector. If time changes membership, name the exact point, interval, or policy. If time does not change membership, do not add a fictitious temporal field merely to complete the tuple.

#### A.2.6:6.2 - `U.Scope` - set-valued scope

`U.Scope` is a durable value with one exact extension of mathematical ValueKind `ContextSliceSet`. `U.ClaimScope`, `U.WorkScope`, and `U.PublicationScope` are its C.3 specializations for receiving uses; the specialization does not copy the extension or add another identity discriminator.

For exact scope `S` and exact slice `x`, the primitive delimitation semantics is:

```text
member(x, S)
```

The predicate has the exact slice and exact scope as arguments. It is not by itself an explicitly individuated `U.Relation` occurrence. Included slices satisfy it; excluded slices do not. The excluded area is not materialized as an unbounded complement entity.

For effective reference scheme `RS`, define `extension_RS(S) := { x : U.ContextSlice | member(x, S) }`. Two scope designators resolve to the same extensional `U.Scope` value when their extensions contain exactly the same independently identified slices under the same or explicitly reconciled reference scheme. An equivalent predicate expression, unit conversion, factoring, or publication change can preserve that value; a boundary change that adds or removes even one slice identifies another scope value.

A set or predicate expression, table, diagram, or query result can represent or designate a scope or a set of evaluated slices under C.29 and C.2.1.

USM admits `subset`, `intersect`, `spanUnion`, `translate`, `widen`, and `narrow` over exact scope extensions. `refit` is a same-extension normalization: it changes a predicate expression, units, or factoring while preserving `member(x,S)` for every exact slice under the effective reference scheme. A changed expression may require another declaration or claim-bearing episteme edition under its direct governor; it identifies another `U.Scope` only when the extension changes.

If a receiving use requires stable identity for membership occurrences, A.2.6 must first declare a direct relation kind with exact participant meanings, obtaining condition, recurrence rule, and non-optional occurrence-identity rule under A.6.REL. Until then, do not use `ScopeDelimitationRelation`, `ScopeDelimitationMode`, or `ScopeDelimitationInterval`.

#### A.2.6:6.3 - `U.ClaimScope` (G) and membership evaluation

`U.ClaimScope` is the exact set-valued scope used to say where one claim holds. The claim-bearing `U.Episteme` and the scope value are distinct; the episteme designates the exact scope current for that claim.

An evaluation of `member(x, S)` is also separate:

* the predicate semantics determine membership;
* an exact system performs dated evaluation work by an exact method, using a direct evaluation relation or A.6.1 operation binding;
* a separately current C.2.1 result episteme may state `true`, `false`, or `unknown`;
* evidence and freshness claims remain under A.10 and their direct governors.

`unknown` reports that the evaluation cannot currently decide because a required selector, designation resolution, or translation input is unavailable. It does not mean `false`, does not exclude the slice, and does not create a third world-side membership state. A receiving guard abstains, narrows the attempted use, or follows an explicitly governed reliance policy; it does not rewrite the predicate.

One exact `U.ClaimScope` participates in `ModelApplicabilityRelation` when model applicability is current. A declared `ModelApplicabilityInterval` belongs to an assertion or occurrence description. The actual applicability occurrence uses the maximal continuous extent over which its predicate obtains, as governed by A.1.1; the interval is not another direct participant.

A `BoundedModelUseStructure` may be selected over exact model-applicability and other governed relation occurrences under applied constraints that refer to exact claim-scope values. Keep the scope value distinct from the two ways it can affect structure identity. A bare scope, slice, membership outcome, or displayed boundary never enters A.22 identity. One exact `U.ClaimScope` remains a participant of an independently governed `ModelApplicabilityRelation`; when that exact obtaining occurrence is selected into the structure, the occurrence contributes through A.22's relation-occurrence discriminator. Separately, one exact applied constraint claim may refer to that scope and contribute through A.22's applied-constraint discriminator. Neither route turns the scope into a structure constituent, a membership-relation occurrence, or a second delimiter. The same scope may participate in differently selected relation occurrences or be referenced by differently identified structures, and a changed structure does not by itself reidentify the scope.

**Expression.** State a Claim scope as an exact predicate or condition block over slice selectors: assumptions, parameter ranges, cohorts, platform or standard editions, exact local senses when current, and time conditions only when they change membership.

**Algebra.** Serial dependencies use intersection. Independently supported areas may use `spanUnion` with the independence basis stated. `widen` and `narrow` change the declared set; `refit` preserves it. `translate` uses the section 7.5 Bridge-plus-use-claim branch and keeps reliance separate.

#### A.2.6:6.4 - `U.WorkScope` — scope of doing Work (capability)

**Carrier.** `U.Capability` (a system’s ability to deliver specified `U.Work`).

**Meaning.** `U.WorkScope` is the set of `U.ContextSlice` values under which a capability's deliverability claim may be evaluated. Work-measure targets and qualification windows are checked separately at use time; they are not members or identity fields of the scope.

**Expression.** The capability declaration designates an exact `U.WorkScope` expressed only as conditions over `U.ContextSlice`: environment, versioned standards or platforms, resource regimes, exact local senses when current, and `gammaTime` only when time changes membership. Quantitative deliverables and qualification windows are not part of the scope value:
* Declare targets as **work-measure target sets** (e.g., latency <= L, throughput >= T, tolerance <= epsilon) bound in guards (WG‑2).
* Declare inspection/recertification policies as **qualification-window policies** bound in guards (WG‑3).
The use‑time admission requires **all** of: `WorkScope covers JobSlice` **AND** `WorkMeasures satisfied` **AND** `qualificationWindowHolds(capability, qualificationWindowPolicy, evaluationTime)`.

**Method–Work gating.** A Work step’s guard MUST check that the target slice is **covered** by the capability’s Work scope **and** that required measures and qualification windows are satisfied.

**Composition and Delta-moves.** Work scope uses the same algebra as Claim scope (intersection / `spanUnion` / `translate` / `widen` / `narrow` / `refit`). Section 7.5 selects `translate` only for exact local-sense translation through an obtaining F.9 Bridge plus the separate affirmative C.2.1 claim and its current reliance branch.

**Separation from knowledge.** A Work scope is a set-valued scope. The capability declaration uses it to delimit where a deliverability claim is evaluated. Measurements and monitoring may support that claim through separately governed evidence and reliance judgments.

**Required guard facets (capabilities).**
* **Work-measure target set (mandatory).** A set of measurable targets with units and tolerated ranges, evaluated on the JobSlice.
* **Qualification-window policy (mandatory for operational use).** A time policy stating when the capability is considered qualified; evaluated at the exact evaluation time selected by the receiving guard, not copied into `U.WorkScope`.
These facets are **separate** from `U.WorkScope` and live in the **R‑lane** (assurance). They MUST be referenced in Method–Work guards (see §10.3 WG‑2/WG‑3).

#### A.2.6:6.5 - `U.PublicationScope` — scope of a publication view or publication form
**Carrier.** A publication view or form is rendered on a carrier; the carrier is a separate object.
**Meaning.** The set of `U.ContextSlice` where a **publication** (a view, card, or lane about some object or morphism) is **admissible for use** within its underlying Claim scope or Work scope.

**Relation to other scopes (normative).**
* If the publication is **about an episteme `E`**:
  `PublicationScope(view_E) ⊆ ClaimScope(E)`.
* If the publication is **about a capability `C`**:
  `PublicationScope(view_C) ⊆ WorkScope(C)`.
* If the publication is **about a composition**, its scope is a subset of the intersection of the exact contributing scopes. When exact local senses require translation, use section 7.5 for each affected source scope: obtaining F.9 Bridge, separate affirmative C.2.1 use claim, and current A.10 or B.3 reliance before the returned scopes are intersected.

**Expression.** Declare `U.PublicationScope` as an exact predicate over only the `U.ContextSlice` selectors that restrict publication use: for example versioned standards, environment, audience, interface availability, exact local senses, or `gammaTime` when time changes membership. It may be narrower than the underlying scope but must not be wider.

**Algebra and Delta-moves.** Publication scope uses the USM algebra. A widened publication scope is admissible only when the resulting set remains a subset of every relevant underlying Claim scope or Work scope and the publication conditions support each added slice; the underlying scope need not change when it was already broader.

**Orthogonality to measurement.** `U.PublicationScope` is a **USM scope object** (set‑valued), not a CHR Characteristic and MUST NOT appear as a slot in a `U.CharacteristicSpace`.

**View refinement (profiles).** When a publication profile or view **refines** another, its `U.PublicationScope` **MUST** be a subset of the scope of the profile or view it refines (for example, a typed card may require additional pins).

### A.2.6:7 - Scope Algebra

#### A.2.6:7.1 - Membership and coverage

For exact slice `x` and scope `S`, evaluate `member(x, S)`.

* `true`: the slice is included and the scope condition for the attempted use passes;
* `false`: the slice is excluded and that use stops or selects another scope;
* `unknown`: the available evaluation cannot decide; the guard abstains or follows an explicitly governed reliance policy without asserting exclusion.

For a finite target set `T : ContextSliceSet`, `coversSet(S,T)` abbreviates `for every x in T, member(x,S)`. Scope-to-scope `scopeSubset(S1,S2)` instead means `for every x, member(x,S1) implies member(x,S2)`. A target set is neither a scope nor a substitute for one. There is no “close enough” membership and no implicit widening.

Membership evaluation work, its inputs and A.6.1 bindings, an optional C.2.1 result episteme, and a C.29 table remain neighboring objects.

#### A.2.6:7.2 - Serial Composition (Intersection)

**Rule S‑INT (serial).** For an essential dependency chain `C1 → C2 → … → Ck` that supports a claim/capability, the effective scope along that chain is:

```
Scope_serial = ⋂_{i=1..k} Scope(Ci)
```

If `Scope_serial = ∅`, the chain is **inapplicable** and MUST NOT contribute to published scope.

**Monotonicity.** Adding a new essential dependency can only narrow (or leave unchanged) the serial scope.

#### A.2.6:7.3 - Parallel Support (SpanUnion)

**Rule P‑UNION (parallel).** If there exist **independent** support lines `L₁,…,Lₙ` for the **same** claim/capability, each with serial scope `S_i`, the publisher MAY declare:

```
Scope_published = SpanUnion({S_i})  =  ⋃_{i=1..n} S_i
```

**Constraints.**

* Independence MUST be justified (different support lines must not rely on the same weakest link).
* The union MUST NOT exceed the union of supported slices; “hopeful” areas are disallowed.
* Publishers SHOULD annotate coverage density/heterogeneity (informative) to aid R assessment, but numeric “coverage” is not part of G.
* **Independence criterion.** Support lines in a **SpanUnion** MUST be partitioned so that each line has a set of **essential components** disjoint from the others’ essential components (no shared weakest link). The partition (or a certificate thereof) SHALL be referenced in the publication.

#### A.2.6:7.4 - Why a **G-ladder/levels/scales** is not needed (and **must not** be introduced)

**1) G is not an ordinal scale; it is set-valued.**
Under **USM**, `U.ClaimScope` is a **set‑valued** **USM scope object** over `U.ContextSlice`. The only well‑typed primitives are **membership** and **set operations** (`⊆`, `∩`, `⋃`). Imposing ordinal “levels” such as **G0…Gk** violates the type discipline and produces non‑invariant behavior (the **same set** could be “rated” with different numbers under different heuristics). (See also LEX‑CHR‑STRICT.)

**2) G composes via `∩` / `SpanUnion`, not via `min` / `avg`.**
USM already fixes composition: along a **dependent path** use **intersection**; across **independent support lines** publish **SpanUnion**. None of these operations relies on (or preserves) any linear order. An ordinal “G ladder” invites people to take **minimums/averages**, which is **incorrect** for sets and breaks the established algebra.

**3) A G ladder drags in “abstraction level,” which is orthogonal.**
Early “G ladders” effectively encoded **abstraction/typing** (instances -> patterns -> formal classes/types -> up-to-iso). That is valuable **didactics**, but **not applicability**. **Abstraction** is captured, if needed, by **`AbstractionTier (AT)`** as an optional facet; **applicability** is **`U.ClaimScope (G)`**.

**4) A G ladder breaks locality and Bridge semantics.**
When exact local senses require translation, an obtaining F.9 Bridge establishes their direct semantic relation while a separate C.2.1 claim states the proposed mapping rule and tolerated loss. There is no canonical way to translate an ordinal G level: the mapped area may be narrower or differently factored. USM translates exact sets only through that bounded claim and keeps A.10 or B.3 reliance separate rather than rewriting G.

**5) A G ladder duplicates ESG guards without adding decision power.**
What teams often want to “compress into a G number” is actually (a) the quality of expression and (b) the completeness of the declared scope. The first is an F threshold; the second is handled by explicit guards: `Scope covers TargetSlice`, `gammaTime is explicit` only when membership varies with time, and a separate freshness-window check when current. A ladder for G adds confusion but no decision power.

**Normative directive.**
`U.ClaimScope (G)` **SHALL** remain a **set‑valued USM scope object**; **no ordinal or numeric ladder SHALL be defined** for G. If a profile needs scalar reporting, it MAY publish an explicit **report‑only** proxy **`CoverageMetric(G)`**, but **`CoverageMetric(G)` MUST NOT substitute for `G`** in norms, gates, Bridge semantics, bounded-use claims, or reliance decisions. Authoring and gating **SHOULD** use **F thresholds** (C.2.3) and **explicit guard predicates** (A.2.6) rather than pseudo‑levels of G.

#### A.2.6:7.5 - Translation across exact local senses

Use translation only when ordinary designation resolution cannot settle the exact local senses needed by the target membership predicate. Then proceed in this order:

1. resolve the source and receiving F.17 `SchemeSenseCell` values and name the exact obtaining F.9 Bridge that relates them;
2. state the proposed scope translation separately: name the source scope, target scheme, source-to-receiving direction, scope-correspondence rule, and tolerated loss, then cite the exact current C.2.1 claim with that Bridge as EntityOfConcern and affirmative polarity for this use;
3. before a guard relies on the claim, require the exact A.10 evidence-provenance relation for this bounded use; ordinary reliance requires `RelianceDisposition=pass`; when an actual named assurance claim is current, require its B.3 `AssuranceResult` for that same use with `disposition=supported-for-use`; and
4. use `translate(Bridge, UseClaim, SourceScope, TargetReferenceScheme)` as the C.29 mathematical representation, or invoke `deriveTranslatedScope` with those same four values when one actual calculation and returned scope are needed.

The Bridge establishes the direct semantic correspondence. The separate claim selects this translation's direction, rule, and tolerance. A Bridge profile, Bridge Card, reference-scheme difference, project label, or slice designator cannot supply that claim or its reliance basis. A missing or non-obtaining Bridge blocks the semantic branch. A missing or non-affirmative use claim blocks reliance. A non-passing A.10 disposition blocks ordinary reliance; when an actual named assurance claim is current, a B.3 result other than `supported-for-use` stops or narrows the assurance-bearing use. None of these outcomes makes an otherwise obtaining Bridge false.

An A.10 `pass`, or a B.3 `AssuranceResult` with `disposition=supported-for-use`, supports only the named use; neither authorizes it. A direct domain rule may require an assurance claim, but it must be stated separately. Observed mismatch, calibration error, and counterexamples are evidence about the use claim. The permitted loss is the tolerance inside that claim. If the rule and tolerance permit translation only for part of the source scope, identify that part and return its target image. Neither the Bridge nor the claim supplies direct support for adding a slice, and neither makes membership true. The exact `deriveTranslatedScope` application remains an A.6.1 operation application; the claim and reliance basis do not prove that it occurred.

#### A.2.6:7.6 - Δ‑Operations (Widen, Narrow, Refit)

* **Δ‑G+ (widen).** Monotone expansion: `S proper-subset S-prime`. Every added slice requires direct support under the receiving use; a Bridge and affirmative translation-use claim can define a mapping but supply no such support by themselves.
* **ΔG− (narrow).** Monotone restriction: `S′ ⊂ S`. Often used to remove areas invalidated by new findings.
* **Refit.** A different expression or parameterization designates the same extensional scope after normalization (for example, changing units or factoring common predicates). Refit MUST NOT alter membership and does not create another scope value.

**Refit (normalization).** A refit **MUST preserve membership** exactly: `extension_RS(S_after) = extension_RS(S_before)`, so both expressions designate the same scope value. Any change that alters boundary inclusion through rounding, unit conversion, or discretization is a ΔG± change, not a refit.

**Edition triggers.** A changed extension identifies a different scope value. A changed predicate expression with the same exact extension preserves the scope value but is a content change in the declaration or claim-bearing episteme that carries the expression; its direct governor decides whether another episteme edition is needed.

**Discriminating cases.** Under one effective reference scheme, `20 °C <= temperature <= 30 °C` and the exactly converted `293.15 K <= temperature <= 303.15 K` have the same extension and can be related as a refit while designating the same scope. Replacing the inclusive upper boundary with `temperature < 30 °C` removes every slice exactly at `30 °C`; that one membership-boundary change identifies another scope rather than a refit.

#### A.2.6:7.7 - Invariants

* **I-LOCAL.** Interpret membership under the effective reference scheme and exact local senses current to the declaration. Translate only through an obtaining F.9 Bridge plus the separate affirmative C.2.1 claim for that translation; keep A.10 or B.3 reliance outside membership truth.
* **I‑SERIAL.** Serial scope is an **intersection**; it cannot grow by adding dependencies.
* **I‑PARALLEL.** Parallel scope MAY grow by union, but only where **independently supported**.
* **I‑WLNK.** Weakest‑link applies to **F** and **R** on dependency paths; **G** follows set rules (∩ / ⋃).
* **I‑IDS.** Idempotence: Intersecting or unioning a set with itself does not change it.
* **I‑EMPTY.** Empty scope is a first‑class value; guards MUST treat it as “not applicable”.

#### A.2.6:7.8 - Empty & Partial Scopes

* **Empty scope (`∅`).** No slice satisfies the declared predicate. A receiving guard stops.
* **Partial scope.** Publishers SHOULD avoid “global” language when actual scope is thin; instead, publish explicit slices and (informatively) coverage hints to guide R assessment.

### A.2.6:8 - Locality, Time & Version Semantics

#### A.2.6:8.1 - Local interpretation without a context container

Interpret a scope predicate under the effective reference scheme and exact local senses named by the claim or scope declaration. Evaluate it against exact `U.ContextSlice` values.

Do not assume that a similarly named selector elsewhere has the same sense. Use ordinary designation resolution when it suffices. Use `translate` only when exact local senses need an obtaining F.9 Bridge and a separate affirmative C.2.1 claim states the proposed translation's direction, rule, and tolerance; establish the current A.10 or B.3 reliance branch before acting on the returned scope.

#### A.2.6:8.2 - Time selector `Γ_time`

When membership depends on time, the scope predicate and target slice name an exact `gammaTime` point, interval, or policy and state which boundary changes a slice from member to non-member or back. Implicit “latest” is forbidden. A time-independent predicate need not inspect `gammaTime`. Keep every selector already declared in the slice schema; do not invent a time selector merely to complete a new declaration. Evidence freshness remains a separate R-lane predicate.

#### A.2.6:8.3 - Standards, versions & notations

When a standard, interface, or schema edition affects membership, name the exact edition. A notation change with faithful designation resolution does not change G. If exact local senses require translation, the F.9 Bridge establishes their relation, the separate C.2.1 claim states this translation's rule and tolerance, and A.10 or B.3 governs reliance.

#### A.2.6:8.4 - Determinism of evaluation

For a fixed exact scope, exact slice, and available evaluation inputs, the evaluation method returns one reproducible result. `false` stops the attempted use. `unknown` also blocks admission but does not assert non-membership.

#### A.2.6:8.5 - Interaction with R (freshness & decay)

For empirical claims and operational capabilities, **R** typically binds evidence freshness windows. Scope does not decay with time; **trust in the support** does. Guards MAY combine “Scope covers” with “Evidence freshness holds” as separate predicates.

### A.2.6:9 - Lexical Discipline (Part E compliance)

**L‑USM‑1 (names).** Use **Claim scope (G)** for epistemes, **Work scope** for capabilities, and **Publication scope** for publication views or forms. Use **Scope** for the common extensional scope value. Avoid naming any **characteristic** as “applicability,” “envelope,” “generality,” “capability envelope,” or “validity”.

**L‑USM‑2 (Work and Run).** Prefer **Work** and **Run** vocabulary from A.15 for system execution contexts. Do not introduce “operation” or “operating” as characteristic names; use **Work scope**.

**L‑USM‑3 (Validation).** “Validation/Validate” remain reserved for **LA** in assurance lanes (Part B). Do not name a scope object “validity”.

**L-USM-4 (Domain).** “Domain” is a recognition cue, not a guard input. Name the exact `U.ContextSlice` selectors needed by the membership predicate.

**L-USM-5 (First mention).** On first use in a pattern or working instruction, write “Claim scope (G)” so the F-G-R meaning is recoverable.

### A.2.6:10 - Guard Patterns (ESG & Method–Work)

#### A.2.6:10.1 - Common guard shape

A claim-scope guard starts with one exact judgment:

```text
membershipResult := evaluateMembership(TargetSlice, ClaimScope, InterpretationBasis)
```

Admit the scope condition only when the result is `true`. Stop on `false`. On `unknown`, abstain, obtain the missing input, narrow the attempted use, or apply a separately governed reliance policy. Evaluate any required freshness, formality-threshold, time-currentness and assurance conditions separately. The gate decision remains under A.21.

Add a translation branch only when the membership predicate uses exact local senses that ordinary designation resolution cannot align. Require the obtaining F.9 Bridge and the separate affirmative C.2.1 claim for this translation before deriving a scope, then require the current A.10 or B.3 reliance branch before the receiving guard relies on it. A different reference scheme or location label alone is not such a trigger.

#### A.2.6:10.2 - Claim-scope guard family

**EG-1 - Exact membership.**

```text
member(TargetSlice, ClaimScope) = true
```

Name the exact claim-bearing episteme, exact `U.ClaimScope`, and exact target slice. The episteme, scope, and slice remain different values.

**EG-2 - Formality or evidence, only when current.** A receiving state may separately require a C.2.3 formality threshold or an A.10 freshness judgment.

**EG-3 - Unknown evaluation.** When a required selector, designation resolution, or translation input is unavailable, return `unknown` as the result binding of the exact `evaluateMembership` application, or as the result of the directly governed evaluation when no reusable application is current. Abstain or follow the exact receiving reliance policy; do not assert `member = false`. Add a C.2.1 result episteme only when a named receiving use needs the conclusion to persist. Use A.15.PROD only when the current claim is that dated work first constituted that episteme.

**EG-4 - Translation.** When exact local senses differ, require the obtaining F.9 Bridge and the separate affirmative C.2.1 claim naming this scope translation's direction, rule, and tolerance. After the exact A.10 or B.3 branch supports reliance for that use, derive the scope with `deriveTranslatedScope(SourceScope, ExactBridgeOccurrence, ExactUseClaim, TargetReferenceScheme)`, then use that returned scope in `evaluateMembership`. Scheme difference alone does not select this branch.

**EG-5 - Scope-value versus declaration change.** Widen or narrow only when the extension gains or loses at least one independently identified slice; that extension change identifies another `U.ClaimScope`. A changed predicate expression with the same exact extension is a refit: it preserves the exact scope value and may require another scope declaration or claim-bearing episteme edition under its direct governor. A result-record, table, or selected-structure change alone changes neither the scope value nor its declaration.

#### A.2.6:10.3 - Method–Work guard families (capabilities)

**WG‑1 - WorkScopeCoverage (mandatory).**
A capability can be used to deliver a Work step only if:

```
U.WorkScope(capability) covers JobSlice
```

**WG‑2 - work-measure target set satisfied** (mandatory for deliverables).
Guards MUST bind quantitative measures that the capability promises in the JobSlice:

```
SLO and target measures satisfied (latency ≤ L, throughput ≥ T, tolerance ≤ ε, … )
```

**WG‑3 - qualification-window policy holds** (mandatory for operational use).
Operational guards MUST assert that the exact qualification-window predicate (qualification, inspection, or recertification) holds at the receiving guard's exact evaluation time:

```
qualificationWindowHolds(capability, qualificationWindowPolicy, evaluationTime) = true
```

**WG-4 - Translation branch for capability use.**

Translate `U.WorkScope` only when its condition predicates use exact local senses that differ from those needed by the job slice. Require the obtaining F.9 Bridge and a separate affirmative C.2.1 claim naming this Work-scope translation's direction, rule, and tolerance; establish the exact A.10 or B.3 reliance branch before the capability guard uses the result. A capability object and job slice carry no hidden `.Context` field that automatically selects this branch.

Observed mapping loss is evidence about the use claim, and permitted loss is its tolerance. If the claim's rule and tolerance permit translation only for part of the source Work scope, identify that part and return its target image.

**WG‑5 - Δ(WorkScope).**
When widening Work scope (new operating ranges/platforms), the guard MUST require evidence at the new slices (measures + qualification windows). A membership-preserving refit does not itself require new deliverability evidence for the unchanged slices.

#### A.2.6:10.4 - Translation guard

Use this branch only after the exact local-sense translation need, the obtaining F.9 Bridge, and the separate affirmative C.2.1 claim for this translation are current. The claim names the source-to-receiving direction, scope-correspondence rule, and tolerated loss. Before the receiving guard relies on it, require the exact passing A.10 branch or, when an actual named assurance claim is current, a B.3 `AssuranceResult` that carries the same bounded use with `disposition=supported-for-use`.

```text
translatedScope := deriveTranslatedScope(SourceScope, ExactBridgeOccurrence, ExactUseClaim, TargetReferenceScheme)
membershipResult := evaluateMembership(TargetSlice, translatedScope, InterpretationBasis)
```

The source claim-bearing episteme designates `SourceScope`. The Bridge relates exact local senses under F.9. The C.2.1 claim supplies this translation's rule and tolerance, and A.10 or B.3 supplies the separate reliance basis. An unmapped slice yields `unknown` for the attempted evaluation unless the returned scope explicitly excludes it; it is not silently dropped and reported as false.

#### A.2.6:10.5 - Time selector

When membership depends on time, name an exact `gammaTime` point, interval, or policy and the boundary that changes membership. Keep every selector already declared in the slice schema, even when this predicate does not inspect it. If a work qualification or evidence-freshness condition varies with time, name its exact evaluation time and interval or policy under that condition's direct governor rather than copying it into scope. For example, `qualificationWindowHolds(capability, Recertification90d, evaluationTime)` is a separate guard; it is not a scope selector.

Do not write implicit “latest.” Do not invent a time selector merely to complete a new slice declaration.

### A.2.6:11 - Archetypal Grounding - Worked Examples

#### A.2.6:11.1 - Claim-scope membership boundary

Claim-bearing episteme `E_adhesive` states that Adhesive X retains at least 85 percent tensile strength on Al6061 for two hours at 120-150 °C under rig edition `Calib-v3`. It designates exact claim scope `G_adhesive`.

* `slice_in = {substrate=Al6061, temp=140°C, dwell=90min, rig=Calib-v3}`. `member(slice_in, G_adhesive)` is true.
* `slice_out = {substrate=Al6061, temp=160°C, dwell=90min, rig=Calib-v3}`. Membership is false; the attempted use stops.
* `slice_unknown = slice_in`, evaluated with an interpretation basis whose required rig-edition resolution is unavailable. Evaluation returns `unknown`; it neither excludes the slice nor permits the use.

`LabEvaluator_A` may perform exact membership-evaluation work through the declared USM operation. When a named audit or replay use needs a judgment to persist, a C.2.1 episteme may record it. A table showing the three rows is a C.29 representation.

The same `G_adhesive` may participate in two independently governed model-applicability relation occurrences and may be referred to by exact applied constraint claims in two A.22 structures. Only a selected obtaining model-applicability occurrence or an exact constraint claim as applied contributes through its corresponding A.22 discriminator; the common scope itself contributes through neither path and neither merges nor identifies the relations or structures. A declared applicability interval in either occurrence description is separate from the actual maximal continuous obtaining extent.

#### A.2.6:11.2 - Translation only when local senses require it

An assembly use expresses temperature through an exact local calibration sense different from the laboratory sense used in `G_adhesive`. F.9 Bridge `B-lab-assembly-temp` obtains between those two cells under its calibration-correspondence profile; the profile contains no translation-use rule or loss tolerance.

Separate C.2.1 claim `C-adhesive-scope-translation` has that Bridge as EntityOfConcern and affirmative polarity. Its content names use `translate G_adhesive for the assembly membership check`, direction laboratory-to-assembly, the calibration rule for mapping the source interval, and tolerance `no selector-meaning loss and at most 2 °C boundary uncertainty`.

Use that translation only while exact A.10 relation `EP-adhesive-scope-translation` connects the claim and that bounded use to evidence record `CalibrationComparisonRecord.Calib-v3-to-AssemblyCalibration-v5.2026-07-25`. Provenance edge `CalibrationComparisonRecord.Calib-v3-to-AssemblyCalibration-v5.2026-07-25 --carriedBy--> CalibrationComparisonRegister.Calib-v3-to-AssemblyCalibration-v5.2026-07-25.csv` names its carrier. The window runs from `2026-07-25` through `2026-10-23` and closes earlier if either calibration edition, the mapping rule, or the 2 °C tolerance changes.

The path supports neither reverse translation, a mapping outside the named rule or tolerance, nor a claim that the A.6.1 application or membership evaluation occurred. If the record, carrier, or provenance edge is missing or stale, or the window closes, stop before translation and set `RelianceDisposition=reopen`; otherwise `RelianceDisposition=pass` applies only to this bounded use. No assurance claim is made.

For this case, stipulate that the actual A.6.1 application `deriveTranslatedScope(G_adhesive, B-lab-assembly-temp, C-adhesive-scope-translation, AssemblyReferenceScheme)` applies the named rule and tolerance and returns the receiving scope `[122,148]°C`. The receiving membership evaluation uses that scope.

If the receiving use merely uses another designation for the same sense under an ordinary resolvable reference scheme, introduce no Bridge, use claim, or translation.

#### A.2.6:11.3 - Capability: robotic weld Work scope

* **Context:** `RobotCell‑Weld@2026`.
* **Capability:** `WeldCapability` — “Weld seam W at bead width 2.5 ± 0.3 mm, cycle ≤ 12 s.”
* **Work scope:** `{humidity<60 %, current∈[35,45]A, wire=ER70S‑6, controller=FW‑2.1}`.
* **Job slice:** `{humidity=55 %, current=40A, wire=ER70S‑6, controller=FW‑2.1}`.
* **Qualification policy:** in this example, `Recertification90d` considers `WeldCapability` qualified for 90 days from the certification date recorded in the controller certificate.
* **Qualification evaluation time:** `2026-07-25`, outside the Work-scope tuple.
* **Guards (WG‑1..3):** coverage **true**; measures satisfied; `qualificationWindowHolds(WeldCapability, Recertification90d, 2026-07-25)` is **true** because certification occurred on `2026-05-26`.
* **Outcome:** capability admitted for this Work.

Controller certificate age does not change Work-scope membership in this case. When the 90-day qualification condition fails, WG-3 stops operational use without removing the Job slice from the scope.

#### A.2.6:11.4 - Serial intersection (API + dataset compatibility)

* **Claim A (API Standard):** `v2.3` request schema with constraint “idempotent under retry”.
* **Claim B (Dataset cohort):** “metrics valid for cohort K with schema `ds‑14`”.
* **Composition:** service S depends on both A and B → **serial intersection** of Claim scopes: `{api=v2.3} ∩ {cohort=K, schema=ds‑14}`.
* **Target slice:** `{api=v2.3, cohort=K, schema=ds‑14}` → membership **true**.
* **Target drift (e.g., `ds‑15`).** The changed target slice lies outside the intersection ⇒ path inapplicable for that slice.

#### A.2.6:11.5 - Parallel support (SpanUnion) in a safety case

* **Line L1:** tests on **dry asphalt** support braking property; scope `S1={surface=dry, speed≤50 km/h}`.
* **Line L2:** simulations for **wet asphalt**; scope `S2={surface=wet, speed≤40 km/h}`.
* **Independence basis:** partition `P-braking` identifies complete disjoint essential-component sets for this braking claim: L1 uses `DryTrackTestRecord` and `DryRigCalibration`; L2 uses `WetBrakeModel`, `WetValidationRecord`, and `WetRigCalibration`.
* **Published scope:** `SpanUnion({S1,S2})` = `{(dry, ≤50), (wet, ≤40)}`, with reference to `P-braking`.
* **Guard:** allowed; union does **not** include `(wet, 45)` because not supported.

With only the method labels, leave P-UNION unresolved. If `CalibrationRecord-Q` is essential to both lines, P-UNION fails for this pair; retain the individual lines and use their component scopes to assess any dependent combination.

#### A.2.6:11.6 - ML model deployment with different local feature senses

* **Model claim:** “AUC >= 0.92 on cohort K, pipeline P, feature sense `Training.F`.”
* **Claim scope:** `{cohort=K, pipeline=P, exactLocalSense=Training.F}`. No `gammaTime` selector is present because this example does not claim that model applicability changes with the slice time.
* **Target slice:** product `On-Device@v7`, pipeline `P-prime`, feature sense `Device.F-prime`.
* **Translation trigger:** ordinary designation resolution fails because `Training.F` and `Device.F-prime` have different declared semantics, not merely different labels. Exact F.9 Bridge `B-training-device-feature` obtains between those cells under a lossy-subset correspondence profile; the profile carries no device-use rule or tolerance.
* **Bounded translation claim:** exact current C.2.1 claim `C-device-feature-scope-translation` has that Bridge as EntityOfConcern and affirmative polarity. It names use `translate the training claim scope for the On-Device@v7 membership check`, direction training-to-device, the subset-mapping rule, and tolerance `no feature-kind substitution and no target slice outside the tested mapped subset`.
* **Evidence and reliance:** Before translating, verify that exact A.10 relation `EP-device-feature-scope-translation` connects claim `C-device-feature-scope-translation` and this bounded use to both records below.
  * **Mapping evidence:** `MappingTestRecord.TrainingF-to-DeviceFprime.OnDevice-v7.2026-07-25`, with exact carrier edge `MappingTestRecord.TrainingF-to-DeviceFprime.OnDevice-v7.2026-07-25 --carriedBy--> MappingTestReport.TrainingF-to-DeviceFprime.OnDevice-v7.2026-07-25.json`.
  * **Training evidence:** `TrainingEvaluationEvidence.K-P-TrainingF.2026-07-25`, with exact carrier edge `TrainingEvaluationEvidence.K-P-TrainingF.2026-07-25 --carriedBy--> TrainingEvaluationReport.K-P-TrainingF.2026-07-25.json`.
  * **Window and stop:** the 180-day window runs from `2026-07-25` through `2027-01-21` and closes earlier if pipeline `P` or `P-prime`, either feature-sense edition, or the tested mapped subset changes. If a record, carrier, or edge is missing or stale, the window closes, or a named dependency changes, stop before translation and set `RelianceDisposition=reopen`; otherwise `RelianceDisposition=pass` applies only to this bounded use.
  * **Boundary:** the path supports neither feature-kind substitution, a target outside the tested subset, material release or assurance, nor a claim that deployment occurred. No assurance claim is made; a material release use stays with its direct release rule, and an actual assurance claim uses B.3.
* **Guard:** bind `translatedScope := deriveTranslatedScope(G, B-training-device-feature, C-device-feature-scope-translation, ProductReferenceScheme)`, then evaluate `evaluateMembership(TargetSlice, translatedScope, InterpretationBasis)`; separately require the chosen formality predicate. The translated scope covers only the tested mapped subset.
* **Outcome:** admit only a target slice in the returned subset; otherwise return false or unknown according to the exact returned scope and available evaluation input.

### A.2.6:12 - Bias-Annotation

USM counters three recurring biases. First, scope wording can hide a claim that the object is usable everywhere; require an addressable `U.ContextSlice` instead of a vague domain phrase. Second, abstract wording can be mistaken for wider scope; keep abstraction tier and detail separate from `U.Scope`. Third, publication convenience can be mistaken for content permission; `U.PublicationScope` bounds the publication surface and does not widen `U.ClaimScope` or `U.WorkScope`.

### A.2.6:13 - Conformance Checklist (USM)

| ID | Requirement |
| --- | --- |
| **CC-USM-1 Exact values.** | Name one exact scope and one exact `U.ContextSlice`; do not substitute a context label, domain phrase, table, or selected structure. |
| **CC-USM-2 Sole delimitation predicate.** | `member(slice, scope)` is the primitive delimitation semantics. `ScopeDelimitationRelation`, `ScopeDelimitationMode`, and `ScopeDelimitationInterval` are absent. |
| **CC-USM-3 Included, excluded, unknown.** | True admits the scope condition, false stops it, and unknown reports an undecided evaluation rather than exclusion. |
| **CC-USM-4 Evaluation separation.** | The acting system, method, dated evaluation work, direct relation or A.6.1 binding, optional C.2.1 result episteme, and evidence use remain separate from predicate truth. An `unknown` result binding does not require that episteme; A.15.PROD applies only to a separately current identity-inception claim. |
| **CC-USM-5 No membership occurrence by default.** | A membership relation kind is admitted only after A.2.6 declares exact participant meanings, obtaining, recurrence, and a non-optional occurrence-identity rule under A.6.REL for a named receiving use. |
| **CC-USM-6 Structure separation.** | A bare scope, slice, membership outcome, or displayed boundary never enters A.22 identity. An exact `U.ClaimScope` remains a participant of its independently governed `ModelApplicabilityRelation`; selecting that exact occurrence contributes through the relation-occurrence discriminator. Separately, an exact applied constraint claim may refer to that scope and contribute through the applied-constraint discriminator. Neither path makes the scope a constituent, a membership occurrence, or a second delimiter. |
| **CC-USM-7 Applicability interval.** | One exact `U.ClaimScope` participates in `ModelApplicabilityRelation`; a declared interval stays in assertion or occurrence-description content, while the actual occurrence extent is derived from maximal continuous obtaining. |
| **CC-USM-8 Set algebra.** | Intersection, independently supported `spanUnion`, widen, narrow, and refit operate on exact scope values; refit preserves membership. |
| **CC-USM-9 Translation boundary.** | `translate` uses an exact obtaining F.9 Bridge plus a separate affirmative C.2.1 claim naming the use, direction, rule, and tolerance. A receiving guard requires A.10 `pass` for ordinary reliance or, when an actual named assurance claim is current, a B.3 `AssuranceResult` for the same use with `disposition=supported-for-use`; scheme or label difference, a profile, or a card supplies none of these. |
| **CC-USM-10 Representation boundary.** | A set expression, query, table, graph, or diagram is a C.29 representation of an independently identified scope or evaluation result. |
| **CC-USM-11 Time only when material.** | Name `gammaTime` and its membership boundary when time changes membership; never use implicit “latest.” A time-independent predicate need not inspect `gammaTime`; retain every selector already declared in the slice, and do not invent one merely to complete a new declaration. |
| **CC-USM-12 Separate reliance.** | Evaluate any required freshness, formality-threshold, time-currentness and assurance conditions separately from membership. The gate decision remains under A.21. A.10 governs ordinary reliance on a cross-scheme translation claim; B.3 applies only to an actual named assurance claim. Either result supports only its named use; neither authorizes that use. `unknown` remains an evaluation result used by the receiving guard; it does not change the scope. |
| **CC-USM-13 Publication and capability specializations.** | `U.WorkScope` and `U.PublicationScope` reuse the same value and membership boundary; their measures, qualification, publication, and carrier relations remain separately governed. |

### A.2.6:14 - Common Anti-Patterns and How to Avoid Them

| Anti-pattern | Why it is wrong | Repair |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Context label as membership | A project, room, domain, or model-use label does not supply the exact slice selectors. | Name the exact `U.ContextSlice` and evaluate `member(slice, scope)`. |
| Evaluation-created membership | Performing work or writing a positive result is treated as making membership true. | Keep predicate truth, evaluation work, result episteme, and evidence separate. |
| Unknown as excluded | Missing data is coerced to false. | Return an `unknown` evaluation result and abstain, narrow the use, or obtain the missing input; persist it only when a named receiving use needs a C.2.1 episteme. |
| `ScopeDelimitationRelation` rebound | Included and excluded slices are reified as direct occurrences. | Use the primitive membership predicate; admit no occurrence without the full A.6.REL identity settlement. |
| Unbounded complement object | Every non-member is gathered into an exclusion entity. | State predicate false for the tested slice; do not materialize the complement. |
| Table-created obtaining | A row, edge, query result, or diagram is treated as membership or scope identity. | Treat it as a C.29 representation of an independently declared scope or evaluation result. |
| Scope-as-structure | A bare scope, slice, membership outcome, or displayed boundary is treated as an A.22 constituent or identity discriminator. | Keep the exact `U.ClaimScope` as a participant of its independently governed `ModelApplicabilityRelation`: only a selected exact occurrence contributes through the relation-occurrence discriminator. If an exact applied constraint claim refers to that scope, the claim contributes separately through the applied-constraint discriminator. The bare scope contributes through neither path and is never copied as a second delimiter. |
| Interval-as-participant | A declared applicability interval is copied into the direct relation signature. | Keep it in assertion or description content and derive actual extent from continuous obtaining. |
| Silent translation | A different scheme, label, or location automatically invokes a Bridge or lets the Bridge define the receiving use. | Translate only after naming exact local senses, an obtaining F.9 Bridge, a separate affirmative C.2.1 claim for the direction, rule, and tolerance, and the current A.10 or B.3 reliance branch. |
| Implicit “latest” | A time-dependent predicate cannot be reproduced. | Name the temporal selector and its membership boundary when time matters; keep every selector already declared in the slice. |
| Unsupported union | `spanUnion` claims areas not supported by independent lines. | State the independence basis or use intersection/narrower supported scope. |

### A.2.6:15 - Consequences

A correct USM use makes scope checks reproducible: every judgment names an exact scope and slice, and true, false, and unknown evaluation results have different actions. Translation appears only for exact local senses after an obtaining F.9 Bridge, a separate affirmative C.2.1 claim about the proposed translation, and its current A.10 or B.3 reliance branch are distinguished. The cost is naming the selectors, mapping rule, tolerated loss, and evidence that actually affect the receiving use while keeping membership truth, operation application, result epistemes, representations, model applicability, and structure separate.

### A.2.6:16 - Playbooks (Informative)

#### A.2.6:16.1 - Manager’s six-step use

1. **Name the claim and exact scope.** Do not start from a context label or table.
2. **Name the target slice.** Bind the full independently identified slice as `targetSlice`; put the selector resolutions and translation inputs needed by this evaluation in `interpretationBasis`.
3. **Translate only when needed.** Use ordinary designation resolution first. If the membership predicate needs translation between exact local senses, name the obtaining F.9 Bridge and the separate affirmative C.2.1 claim for this translation's direction, rule, and tolerance. Derive the scope for the target reference scheme and establish its A.10 or B.3 reliance branch before using the returned scope.
4. **Evaluate membership.** Use the returned translated scope when step 3 derived one; otherwise use the named scope. True admits the scope condition; false stops it; unknown calls for abstention, obtaining the missing input, or narrowing the attempted use.
5. **Keep other checks separate.** Evaluate any required freshness, formality-threshold, time-currentness and assurance conditions separately, along with capability measures and qualification when required. The gate decision remains under A.21.
6. **Persist only what the use needs.** A C.2.1 result episteme may record the judgment when a named receiving use needs it to persist; a C.29 table may display it. Use A.15.PROD only when the current claim is that the work first constituted that episteme.

#### A.2.6:16.2 - Architect’s design rubric for scopes

* **Prefer predicates over prose.** Name the parameters, ranges, and standard editions that affect membership; name `gammaTime` only when time affects membership.
* **Factor common conditions.** Use Refit to normalize units and factor shared predicates; do not widen by stealth.
* **Partition support lines.** If you plan a **SpanUnion**, document independence up front.
* **Publish supported scope.** Add slices as support appears (ΔG+).
* **Design translations early.** Test the direct F.9 Bridge first, then state each proposed translation use separately with its direction, mapping rule, tolerated loss, and evidence plan; do not turn an expected loss score into permission to use the mapping.

#### A.2.6:16.3 - Minimal DSL snippet for scope blocks (illustrative)

```
claimScope:
  effectiveReferenceScheme: MaterialsLabScheme@2026
  Standards:
    - rig: Calib-v3
    - api: v2.3
  env:
    substrate: Al6061
    temp: [120, 150] # °C
    dwell: { max: "2h" }
receivingGuards:
  evidenceProvenanceUse:
    relevance_window_days: 365 # A.10/R guard, not Claim scope
```

*(Illustrative only; the specification does not mandate a particular syntax.)*

#### A.2.6:16.4 - Profiles as Scope configurations (informative)
**Idea.** A **Scope profile** is a **named, editioned configuration** that expands to a concrete `U.Scope` predicate block (over `U.ContextSlice`), used to avoid repetition and to keep declarations consistent across carriers.

**Rules.**
* **P1 (Expansion).** Profiles are macros: guards **MUST** expand them to explicit predicates before evaluating `Scope covers TargetSlice`.
* **P2 (Edition).** Profiles are editioned. A changed predicate expression is a content change for a carrier that references the profile even when the exact scope extension is preserved; a changed extension additionally identifies another scope value.
* **P3 (No stealth widen).** A profile update MUST NOT implicitly widen a carrier’s published scope; ΔG+ must be explicit in that carrier.
* **P4 (Translation awareness).** If a profile expands to predicates whose exact local senses require translation, name the obtaining F.9 Bridge and the separate affirmative C.2.1 claim for that translation's direction, rule, and tolerance. The receiving guard must recover the current A.10 or B.3 reliance branch; a different label, scheme, profile, or Bridge Card alone is insufficient.
* **P5 (No hidden context container).** A profile expands to predicates; it is not a context object, scope pattern, or additional scope kind.

**Examples (illustrative).**
- An engineering team defines `Ops-Lab-v3` as a profile pinning standard editions and environment selectors. It leaves `LabEvidenceRelevanceWindow365d` to the receiving A.10/R guard and contains no `gammaTime`, because evidence age does not change scope membership.
- A field team defines `WinterCampaign-v1` with `gammaTime in [2026-11-01, 2027-03-31]` because the exact scope predicate admits only slices during the declared winter campaign; a slice before or after those boundaries is a non-member.
- A publication stack defines `TechCard‑Lite@Σ` as a profile that **narrows** `U.PublicationScope` to slices where required pins are available.

### A.2.6:17 - Governance Hooks & Audits

#### A.2.6:17.1 - Durable audit evidence, when needed

When a scope-aware decision needs durable audit evidence, its C.2.1 result episteme may name:

* **Using object and exact scope.** The claim-bearing episteme, capability, or publication object designates or uses the exact scope.
* **Exact target slice.** Designate the independently identified slice with its complete declared selector schema and values. Bind the full slice as `targetSlice`; put the selector resolutions and translation inputs needed by this evaluation in `interpretationBasis`. Include `gammaTime` in the schema only when that temporal selector is part of the exact slice being evaluated.
* **Evaluation outcome.** Record `true`, `false`, or `unknown`, plus the evaluation method or work occurrence when replay needs it.
* **Separate guard outcomes.** Record work measures, qualification windows, formality, or freshness only when the receiving use checks them; none is membership.
* **Translation evidence, only when triggered.** Name the exact obtaining F.9 Bridge, the separate C.2.1 claim with its polarity, use, direction, rule, and tolerance, and the exact A.10 or B.3 reliance branch. Record any observed loss as evidence rather than a Bridge identity field.
* **Scope change.** Say whether the declared set widened, narrowed, or remained identical under refit.

#### A.2.6:17.2 - USM compliance levels (informative)

* **USM-Ready.** Exact scope and slice values are declared; editors can distinguish membership from evaluation, evidence, representation, and structure.
* **USM-Guarded.** Guards evaluate exact Claim scope or Work scope membership, including `gammaTime` in the scope predicate only when time changes membership. Measures, qualification, and freshness remain separate checks.
* **USM-Auditable.** Durable result epistemes identify the exact scope, slice, and evaluation result. When translation was triggered, they cite the obtaining F.9 Bridge, separate bounded-use claim, and current A.10 or B.3 reliance.
* **USM‑Composed.** Serial intersection and SpanUnion are implemented in composition tooling.

#### A.2.6:17.3 - Audit checklist (informative)

* Does each guard **name** a concrete **TargetSlice**?
* Is **membership** reproducibly evaluable from the exact declared predicate and required inputs?
* Are **freshness** and **coverage** separate predicates?
* When exact local-sense translation was required, are the obtaining F.9 Bridge, separate C.2.1 use claim, direction, rule, tolerance, polarity, and current A.10 or B.3 reliance branch named?
* For parallel support: is **independence** justified?

#### A.2.6:17.4 - Risk controls (informative)

* **Silent widening.** Require ΔG+ review; flag any scope increase without new direct support. A Bridge may translate supported conditions but does not supply support.
* **Opaque slices.** Disallow “domain” placeholders; enforce addressable selectors.
* **Time drift.** Require an exact `gammaTime` boundary only when the scope predicate itself changes membership across time; keep qualification, calibration, recertification, data-age, and evidence-freshness windows under their direct guards.

### A.2.6:18 - Extended FAQ (informative)

**Q1. Is “Claim scope” the same as “domain”?**
**No.** “Domain” is descriptive and often fuzzy. Claim scope is addressable: it supplies an exact predicate over the `U.ContextSlice` selectors that determine membership, including `gammaTime` only when the predicate changes membership across time. Guards reference the exact slice, not a generic domain.

**Q2. How do we express partial coverage across different cohorts or platforms?**
Declare each supported serial scope (`S₁, S₂, …`) and publish **SpanUnion({Sᵢ})** with independence justification. Do **not** include unsupported slices.

**Q3. Can raising F (formalizing) widen G?**
Only if the formalization **explicitly changes** the scope predicates (ΔG+). Formalization alone does not widen scope.

**Q4. What is the difference between Work scope and SLOs?**
**Work scope** is **where** the capability can deliver; **measures** within the guard are **what** it promises there (SLO targets). Both are required at use time (WG‑1..3).

**Q5. Can we assign numeric coverage to G?**
Not normatively. G is set‑valued. You MAY attach an **informative**, explicitly declared **`CoverageMetric(G)`** (e.g., a proportion under a pinned policy) to aid **R** assessment, but guards use set membership and **`CoverageMetric(G)` MUST NOT replace `G`**.

**Q6. How do we handle “latest data” scopes?**
First decide what “latest” is doing. If it means that evidence or data must be no older than 90 days, do not put it in Claim scope: require the A.10 evidence-provenance path to satisfy its exact 90-day relevance or currentness window at the receiving use time. Put `gammaTime` in the scope only when claim applicability itself changes with the slice time, and state the membership boundary—for example, slices whose observation time falls outside the declared interval are non-members. The word “latest” alone supplies neither boundary.

**Q7. How do we use a scope with differently named slice selectors?**
First resolve whether the designations refer to the same values under the effective reference scheme. If exact local senses differ and membership must be expressed across them, name the obtaining F.9 Bridge. Then state the separate affirmative C.2.1 claim for the proposed translation's direction, mapping rule, and tolerated loss, establish the exact A.10 or B.3 reliance branch, and evaluate the scope returned by `deriveTranslatedScope`.
**Q8. What about abstraction level or detail?**
Keep **AT (AbstractionTier)** and **D (Detail and Resolution)** as orthogonal, optional annotations. They never substitute for **Claim scope** or **Work scope**.

**Q9. Can a capability’s Work scope be broader than a predecessor claim’s Claim scope on a dependency path?**
They are on different carriers. In a serial dependency, the **effective** scope is the **intersection**; the broader one does not dominate.

**Q10. When does an empty scope make sense?**
No slice satisfies the declared predicate, so the receiving guard stops. This may occur during early drafting or after a refutation.

*(Use these source terms only in explanatory notes; not in guards or conformance text.)*

#### A.2.6:19.2 - Minimal data model hints

**ContextSlice tuple (suggested keys):**
`effectiveReferenceScheme`, one exact `declaredSelectorSchema`, the values of every selector in that schema, and optional selector families such as `exactLocalSenseRefs`, `standardOrInterfaceEditions`, `environmentOrPlatformSelectors`, `cohortOrJurisdictionSelectors`, and `gammaTime` when that selector belongs to the declared schema. A scope predicate declares which projection it inspects; it does not define the tuple's identity.

**Claim-scope predicate block:**
`assumptions`, `cohorts`, `platformOrStandardEditions`, `environmentSelectors`, `exactLocalSenseRefs?`, and `gammaTime?` when time changes membership.

**Work-scope predicate block:**
`environmentSelectors`, `platformOrStandardEditions`, `resourceRegimeSelectors`, `exactLocalSenseRefs?`, and `gammaTime?` when time changes membership.

**Publication-scope predicate block:**
the exact audience, interface, availability, and other selectors that restrict publication use, always as a subset of the underlying claim or work scopes.

**Separate use-time guard:**
work-measure targets, qualification windows, evidence freshness, and any decision threshold. These are not fields of the scope value.
*(These are informative; the spec does not mandate a concrete serialization.)*

#### A.2.6:19.3 - Pseudocode membership evaluation (illustrative)

```python
def evaluate_membership(scope, target_slice, interpretation_basis):
    required = scope.required_inputs(target_slice)
    if not interpretation_basis.resolves_all(required):
        return UNKNOWN
    resolved_inputs = interpretation_basis.resolve(required)
    return TRUE if scope.predicate(target_slice, resolved_inputs) else FALSE
```

`required_inputs` identifies the selector resolutions and any translation inputs needed by this scope predicate under the bound `interpretationBasis`. `resolves_all` requires resolved values, not merely available keys or selector tokens; a present but unresolved rig token therefore yields `UNKNOWN`. The full slice remains bound as `targetSlice`; only the needed resolutions are supplied to predicate evaluation. `UNKNOWN` belongs to the evaluation result because a required input is unavailable. The underlying membership predicate remains bivalent for an exact, fully interpreted scope and slice.

### A.2.6:20 - Rationale

A.2.6 needs a scope mechanism to express the set-valued condition under which a claim, work capability, or publication surface may be used. USM makes those membership conditions addressable, composable, and reopenable while preserving the F/G/R separation. When exact local senses require translation, F.9 supplies the Bridge, C.2.1 supplies the separate claim about this use, and A.10 or B.3 supplies reliance; A.2.6 alone governs the scope calculation and membership question.

**Summary.** Across all Contexts, two stable notions recur: (1) **evaluate in a concrete context** (→ `U.ContextSlice`), and (2) **declare where something holds or is deliverable** (→ set‑valued **Scope**). “Context of use,” “operating modes,” “targets,” “class extension,” and “OSED” are all Context‑flavored presentations of **Claim scope** or **Work scope**. Terms like *validity* and *operation* are semantically close but collide with **LA** and FPF’s **Work** and **Run** lexicon; we therefore **do not** adopt them as characteristic names.

**Naming rationale:**

* **“Scope” rather than “envelope/applicability/validity”.** “Scope” is idiomatic in SRE/SW; “validity” clashes with **Validation Assurance (LA)**, and “envelope” suggests geometry rather than **membership**.
* **“Claim scope” vs “Work scope”.** These names distinguish claim uses and capability uses of the common set-valued scope notion.
* **Keep **G**.** The F–G–R triple is canonical; we retain **G** as nickname for **Claim scope**.
* **“Context slice”** keeps the evaluation target addressable through its exact declared selector schema and values; one membership predicate may inspect only a projection without reidentifying the slice.
* **“Operation”, “operating”, and “validity” avoided.** They are **overloaded** in existing FPF lanes (Work, Run, and LA) and create policy ambiguities in guards.

###### A.2.6:20.1.3.2 - Phrasebook (for editors, normative)

* Use **“Claim scope (G) covers TargetSlice”** and **“Work scope covers JobSlice”** in guards.
* When time changes membership, name exact **`gammaTime`** and its membership boundary; never say “latest.” A time-independent predicate need not inspect `gammaTime`, but keep every selector already declared in the slice.
* To compose, say: **“intersection along dependency paths; SpanUnion across independent support lines.”**
* When exact local-sense translation is current, say: **“through an obtaining F.9 Bridge and a separate affirmative C.2.1 claim for this direction, rule, and tolerance; rely on it only through the current A.10 or B.3 branch, then evaluate membership on the returned scope.”**
* When widening/narrowing, write **“ΔG+ / ΔG−”** and log the support change; use **“Refit”** for unit/param normalization.

### A.2.6:21 - Relations - Cross-Pattern Coordination

#### A.2.6:21.1 - With F–G–R (C.2.2)

* **G is Claim scope.** Use set algebra (∩ / SpanUnion).
* **F** remains the expression rigor (C.2.3); **R** captures evidence currentness and bounded reliance. Observed loss may bear on the translation-use claim; its permitted-loss tolerance remains in that claim rather than in G or the Bridge profile.
* **Weakest‑link.** On dependency paths: **F\_composite = min(F)**, **R\_composite = min(R)**; **G** follows §7.2–§7.3 (set rules).

#### A.2.6:21.2 - With Formality (C.2.3)

* **No conflation.** Raising **F** does not change **G** unless scope predicates change.
* **Guarding rigor.** ESG may use `Formality >= F_k` alongside scope coverage.

#### A.2.6:21.3 - With Work & Run (A.15)

* **Work scope** delimits the exact job slices on which a capability's deliverability claim is evaluated.
* Method–Work gates use **Work scope coverage** plus **measures** and **qualification windows**.

#### A.2.6:21.4 - With exact F.9 Bridge occurrences

* **Translation boundary.** Use an exact F.9 Bridge only for exact local-sense translation. State the translation's direction, rule, tolerated loss, and polarity in a separate C.2.1 claim. Before the receiving use proceeds, require A.10 `pass` for ordinary reliance or, when an actual named assurance claim is current, a B.3 `AssuranceResult` for the same use with `disposition=supported-for-use`.
* **Best practice.** If the bounded-use claim's rule and tolerance permit translation only for part of the source scope, identify that part and return its target image; do not turn observed mapping loss into a Bridge identity field or a generic R penalty.

#### A.2.6:21.5 - With Capability governance (A.2.2)

* Capabilities MUST declare **Work scope**, **measures**, **qualification windows**; gates MUST verify all three.
* Capability refits that preserve the set (unit changes) are **Refit**, not Δ(WorkScope).
