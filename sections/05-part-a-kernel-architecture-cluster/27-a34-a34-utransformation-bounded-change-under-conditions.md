## A.3.4 - U.Transformation: Bounded Change Under Conditions

> **Type:** Definitional pattern
> **Status:** Stable
> **Normativity:** Normative except where a section is explicitly informative

### A.3.4:0 - Use This When

Use this pattern when a project must decide whether an actual change occurred and identify that one change. Ask: what continuing subject changed, where the change begins and ends, which facts differ before, during, and after it, and what rule makes this one occurrence rather than unrelated observations.

Use it when the working question is:

- what continuing subject changed: an entity, selected structure, presentation carrier, constituent organization, characteristic-bearing referent, or formal object;
- when a specification's claim content changes, which two C.2.1 epistemes exist, whether their `EpistemeEditionRelation` obtains, whether a continuing carrier or constituent organization changed, and whether revision `U.Work` first constituted the later episteme under `A.15.PROD`;
- which actual characteristic-state and direct-relation facts differ across the boundary;
- what temporal extent, formal ordering, or continuity rule identifies this occurrence;
- which additional claim, if any, is actually being made about method, planned work, performed work, mechanism, flow structure, representation, evidence, publication, or a later use, and which pattern answers that claim.

**Primary EntityOfConcern.** One actual `U.Transformation`: the bounded occurrence identified through the five checks in 4.1. Identify the objects needed for separate planning, enactment, representation, evidence, or later-use claims under their own patterns.

**Primary working reader.** A practitioner or modeler who must identify one actual change for a current engineering, scientific, formal, documentary, or architectural use before relating it to method, work, flow, evidence, or production. The parked-composition branch additionally addresses an FPF author or reviewer only when that use asks whether several changes compose one change or whether that whole could satisfy A.1.

**First useful move.** Name the continuing subject and where the change begins and ends. Write the subject facts that hold before, during, and after that boundary, then state the boundary conditions and the continuity or reidentification rule that make this one occurrence. If the material supplies only a desired state, method, plan, model, trace, or assertion, stop: it has not yet grounded an actual `U.Transformation`.

**Open-world guard.** Not finding a method, work occurrence, evidence item, publication, delivery, acceptance, or later-use relation does not prove that it is absent. It prevents only the particular claim that needs it. Finding one of those objects likewise does not prove that an actual transformation occurred.

**What goes wrong if missed.** Method names become change proof, work traces become laws, process diagrams become execution, dynamics models become permission, temporal trends become intervention claims, mathematical constructions become project-world work, and publications or result records are treated as the change itself.

**What this buys.** The practitioner gets one usable actual-change result without first deciding whether finer changes are its parts. If no composition or holon claim is needed, continue with the ordinary neighboring-object guidance at `4.3`. If such a claim is needed, keep the identified changes and return the parked composition blocker; this pattern does not guess the future architecture. Apply `A.1` only after an accepted architecture supplies the proposed whole and its construction facts. Method, work, flow, representation, evidence, publication, production, and later-use claims stay separate.

**Not this pattern when.**

- If the issue is only a semantic way of doing, use `A.3.1`.
- If the issue is a description of that way, use `A.3.2`.
- If the issue is a state-space and transition-law episteme, use `A.3.3`.
- If the issue is a law-governed operation algebra with admissibility predicates, use `A.6.1` and `E.20`.
- If the issue is planned or dated work, use `A.15.2` or `A.15.1`.
- If the issue is the selected compound transformation-flow structure, its locus, path, path slice, crossing, or flow valuation, use `E.18`.
- If the issue is a graph, algebra, category, tuple, morphism, quotient, fold, refinement, factorization, or wiring expression used to describe that structure mathematically, use `E.18.2` and `C.29`.
- If the issue is a positive temporal aspect of an object or claim, use `C.27.TA`.
- If the issue is adequacy or admissible use of a temporal claim, use `C.27`.
- If the issue is holon recognition without a current actual-change identity or constructive transformation-parthood claim, use `A.1`.

### A.3.4:1 - Problem Frame

FPF often needs to talk about change in physical systems, engineered artifacts, organizations, presentation carriers, constituent organizations, architectures, programs, regulatory situations, and research objects. A revised specification needs an early split: changed claim content identifies two C.2.1 epistemes, not one continuing changed episteme. Test the `EpistemeEditionRelation` between them. Open A.3.4 only for a continuing carrier, constituent organization, or other subject with its own identity rule; if revision `U.Work` first creates the later episteme, use `A.15.PROD` for that first existence. When the source says *process*, *editing*, or *construction*, recover the changed object from the case.


For transformer constitution use `A.3`; for signatures and slot discipline use `A.6.0` and `A.6.5`; for problem-to-work carry-through use `E.18.1`. Section 0 and sections 4.4–4.5 provide the other neighboring routes.

What is missing is a positive first route: identify the actual change, then open only the separate method, work, flow, representation, evidence, publication, or later-use claim the practitioner is making.

### A.3.4:2 - Problem

Without `U.Transformation`, projects repeatedly make category errors:

1. **Method as transformation.** A way of doing is treated as if the change already happened or must happen.
2. **Mechanism as transformation.** A law-governed operation algebra is mistaken for the actual or intended change, although it only states how a transformation may proceed.
3. **Work as transformation law.** A dated work occurrence or trace is treated as if it defined the reusable transformation.
4. **Dynamics as permission.** A state-space or transition-law episteme is used as if it authorized action, gate passage, or result acceptance.
5. **Temporal claim as transformation.** A claim about rate, rhythm, recovery, delay, effort, inertia, freshness, or validity window is used as if it specified the whole change and its conditions.
6. **Formal construction as project-world work.** A morphism, proof construction, or formal transformation inside a mathematical substrate is treated as a physical or organizational change without a realization or work relation.
7. **Publication as transformation.** A report, dashboard, diagram, source span, or published specification is treated as if it were the changed object or the change event.

These errors are expensive because the wrong neighboring pattern then receives the claim. The project may seek evidence for a method when it needs a work trace, compare dynamics models when it needs a transformation boundary, or invoke temporal-claim adequacy when the real problem is the missing transformation relation.

### A.3.4:3 - Forces

| Force | Tension |
| --- | --- |
| Generality and specificity | The same five identification questions must work for physical, biological, software, organizational, documentary, architectural, formal, and epistemic changes. Each domain still keeps its own subject and relation patterns. |
| Possible, planned, actual, modeled, and claimed transformation | A source may call a change possible, planned, enacted, observed, modeled, claimed, or published. Only the changed subject, boundary, before/during/after facts, and continuity rule establish an actual `U.Transformation`; the plan, work, observation, model, assertion, and publication remain separate claims. |
| Neighboring value competition | A method, mechanism, dynamics model, work occurrence, time claim, evidence item, or result can look like *the thing that changed*. Test the actual change first; use the separate pattern for each additional claim. |
| Time and order | Many transformations need a time window, cadence, duration, ordering relation, or refresh condition, but time wording alone does not define the transformation. |
| Mathematical strength and practical use | A formal task, morphism, state space, constructor-theory account, or dynamics model can describe a transformation precisely. Permission, evidence, performed work, and responsibility remain separate questions answered by their own patterns. |

### A.3.4:4 - Solution

#### A.3.4:4.1 - Identify the actual bounded change

`U.Transformation` is the FPF ontic for one actual bounded change. Use the five checks below and keep only the facts needed to distinguish this occurrence:

1. **Changed subject.** Name the continuing entity, selected structure, presentation carrier, constituent organization, characteristic-bearing referent, or formal object and apply its identity rule. If an episteme's claim content differs across the boundary, identify two C.2.1 epistemes and test their `EpistemeEditionRelation`; do not call either one the continuing changed subject. Use A.3.4 only for another continuing subject, or use `A.15.PROD` when revision `U.Work` first constitutes the later episteme.
2. **Extent and boundary.** State the temporal extent of the change, including only gaps admitted by its continuity rule, or state the ordering boundary in a declared formal substrate.
3. **Boundary conditions.** State the conditions that delimit this change from adjacent persistence, work, or change occurrences.
4. **Actual change facts.** Write the characteristic-state facts and relations that actually hold before, during, and after the boundary.
5. **Continuity or reidentification.** If the subject varies internally, the change pauses, or several intervals are proposed, state the rule that says the subject and this occurrence continue across that variation.

Here, **one** means one occurrence at the resolution, subject, extent, and boundary needed for this use. It does not mean elementary, atomic, indivisible, or partless. Later refinement may identify finer changes, and future accepted work may establish constructive parts; sampling or subdividing time establishes neither result.

Treat a possible, desired, planned, predicted, modeled, asserted, or published change as claim content until the occurrence facts above hold. A formal transformation can be actual within an admitted formal substrate, but its formula or proof term remains a `C.29` representation of that independently identified formal change.

#### A.3.4:4.2 - First-use transformation basis

Use these questions as a recognition aid, not as fields of a transformation record:

| Question | What to write | Stop condition |
| --- | --- | --- |
| What changed? | one continuing subject under its identity rule | stop if only a label, file, diagram, or desired object is available |
| Across which boundary? | temporal extent or formal ordering boundary | stop if before and after are merely two unrelated observations |
| What actual facts differ? | the relations and characteristic-state facts that hold before, during, and after the boundary | stop if the only basis is a method, plan, trace, formula, or assertion |
| What delimits one occurrence? | boundary conditions and continuity or reidentification rule | split or leave identity unresolved when the rule does not cover the gap |
| Which later claim or use, if any, relies on this change? | name that claim and apply its pattern: for example dated `U.Work`, a safety evaluation, a publication assertion, or no neighboring use | write only the relation needed by that branch; if no later use is being claimed, add nothing |

**Worked first use.** For a reactor cooling loop, identify the cooling loop as the continuing changed subject, the thermal-power step and stabilization interval as the boundary, the measured temperature-profile facts before and after it, and the operating conditions that delimit the episode. These facts ground `CoolingLoopTransformation-7 : U.Transformation`. The revised operating method, control-law episteme, measurements, safety evaluation, and release decision remain separate objects. This short fixture identifies no dated adjustment `U.Work` occurrence.

Choose only the next claim that the use actually needs:

- **Work.** First identify a dated `U.Work` occurrence under `A.15.1`. If both work and transformation participants are identified, apply the routes and stops in `4.2.4`. The short reactor fixture has not identified that work occurrence, so it makes no work-to-change claim and does not yet report a missing governor.
- **Safety evaluation.** Use case-local `evaluatesTransformation@PlantSafety-v4(SafetyEvaluation-7, CoolingLoopTransformation-7, CoolingLoopSafetyCriterion-v4)` only when all three participants are identified and the predicate's obtaining conditions hold. Identify a decision separately when one is claimed.
- **Publication.** Use a C.2.1 assertion whose EntityOfConcern is `CoolingLoopTransformation-7` and identify its E.24.PUB publication occurrence.

If none of these uses is being claimed, keep the identified transformation and add no neighboring relation.

**Choose the next branch now.** If the current result is one identified transformation and the use needs no positive claim that several changes compose one change or that the change is a holon, continue directly at 4.3. Sections 4.2.1 and 4.2.3 are not prerequisites for that ordinary route. Open them only when the use needs one of those two positive claims; the current advanced branch returns the parked blocker and selects no future architecture.

##### A.3.4:4.2.1 - Keep proposed component and whole-configuration changes separate

Use *component change* and *whole-configuration change* only as ordinary question roles for actual `U.Transformation` occurrences already identified through A.3.4:4.1. They are not additional U-kinds, record fields, or evidence that one change is part of another.

Identify every proposed component change and the proposed whole-configuration change independently. A sampled point, arbitrary subinterval, method step, work part, flow node, graph edge, trace segment, formula term, before-and-after image, shared changed subject, or temporal inclusion establishes neither composition nor absence of finer parts.

The neighboring general patterns do not silently answer the composition question. `A.22` can identify a selected structure whose relation organization changes; `C.27.TA` can identify temporal aspects; `A.14` and `C.13` define structural mereology and a `Γ_m` construction trace. None of those results by itself says that several actual changes compose one actual change. A materialized `Γ_m.sum` trace is a C.2.1 episteme about identified entity-part relations, assembly, and direct identity or reidentification conditions.

One independently identified change of a selected configuration can therefore remain a valid configuration transformation. If the use needs no positive composition or transformation-holon claim, continue with that transformation and the ordinary neighboring-object guidance in `4.3`-`4.8`. If it does need such a claim, retain the identified changes and stop with **missing transformation-composition governor**; a proposed local compound claim also stops with **missing derivation substrate**. Neither stop says that composition is false or that any change is partless.

##### A.3.4:4.2.3 - Apply A.1 only after composition is independently established

Membership in `U.Transformation` supplies no holonhood. A.1 remains the authority for the constructive criterion. This edition of A.3.4 supplies neither a positive transformation-composition result nor the candidate, constituents, constructive part relations, and assembly needed by A.1. Therefore an independently identified configuration transformation remains a valid `U.Transformation`, while positive `U.Holon` classification on the basis of transformation composition stops. The stop is not evidence that no such whole or parts exist.

If future accepted work supplies one whole transformation and its construction facts, apply A.1 without changing its test or assuming which relation form that work chose. A.1 still requires the candidate, constituents, constructive part relations and assembly, reidentification rule, composition-grounded whole-level characteristic, and possible participation in a larger constructive assembly. Recover those facts from the patterns that define them at that time.

A.1 also keeps world-side satisfaction or failure separate from an A.6.1 `true | false | unknown` recognition evaluation, an optional C.2.1 assertion, evidence and assurance, G.11 currentness, receiving-work disposition, and B.2 whole reidentification. Follow A.1 for that separation rather than repeating its full table here.

Stress the current boundary before classifying:

- a pressure increase may be identified as one `U.Transformation` at the resolution needed by the use; sampling or subdivision establishes neither constructive parts nor absence of such parts;
- a switch transition may be treated as effectively instantaneous at the selected temporal resolution and identified as one `U.Transformation`; that resolution claim establishes neither indivisibility nor parts;
- subintervals of continuous biological growth may each be independently identified as transformations, but this pattern does not decide whether they compose one change;
- a formal transformation can be actual under a selected formal substrate, while its formula, morphism, or proof term remains a C.29 representation and supplies no holonhood;
- mounting, wiring, connection, and whole-configuration changes may each be identified independently; the current edition does not make them constituents of one transformation, so positive A.1 classification on that basis does not begin.

##### A.3.4:4.2.4 - Keep work and production claims outside transformation identity

Do not infer a work-to-change connection from shared timing, a common affected subject, or the word *successful*. Once the `U.Work` and `U.Transformation` participants are identified, apply a matching current subject predicate or, when `A.6.RCD` disposition 2 permits it, state the local compound claim over named base facts and an admitted substrate. Preserve the applicable `A.6.RCD` result: `missing-governor` for an absent needed governing rule; `missing-information` for an unavailable fact needed by an existing test; `factually unsupported` when sufficient facts fail its positive test; that rule's inapplicable result when applicability fails; or `missing-substrate` when the proposed derivation lacks admitted constructor semantics.

Production is a separate question. For a production claim, test production-work participation, first existence of an entity, and production completion separately. Apply `A.15.PROD` to the exact work, work part, subject-identity facts, completion criterion, and direct effect facts. A.3.4 contributes only the independently identified transformations.

**Filled positive branch — result:** C.2.1 assertion `BuildWorkPopulatedStore-12` states the local connection between `ReleaseBinary12_BuildWork_2026-07-21T0900_0912 : U.Work` and `ArtifactStorePopulationTransformation_12 : U.Transformation`. The BuildOps predicate `BuildWorkPopulatedStore@BuildOps-v12(work, transformation)` holds only when the `storeWrite` application performed as part of that work changes the same `ArtifactStorePartition_12` across the same boundary. `BuildApplication_12` supplies the performed application and its `builtBinary -> ReleaseBinary_12` binding; the partition's before/after artifact-presence facts ground the transformation. This is an `A.6.RCD` disposition-2 local compound claim, not a universal FPF work-to-change kind or occurrence.

**Pump 14 — current result and earlier no-governor stage:** A.3.4 identifies `T-P14-PRESSURE-RISE : U.Transformation` as the bounded change of continuing `HydraulicLoop_P14`; the loop's discharge-pressure characteristic is `belowBand` at the opening boundary and `inBand` at the closing boundary. The current case record contains relation-declaration episteme `P14-REL-2026`, owned by `Pump14OperationsRelations`, which declares `AdjustmentWorkCausesPressureRise` for exact participants `W-P14-ADJUST-1010-1020 : U.Work` and `T-P14-PRESSURE-RISE`; a separately stated case fact satisfies its actual-causation predicate. Therefore write: `W-P14-ADJUST-1010-1020 caused T-P14-PRESSURE-RISE`. In the explicitly earlier case record, `P14-REL-2026` is absent; at that epistemic stage, keep the same Work and transformation, return `missing-governor: work-to-change claim for <W-P14-ADJUST-1010-1020, T-P14-PRESSURE-RISE>`, and route the missing declaration to `Pump14OperationsRelations` instead of asserting causation.

#### A.3.4:4.3 - Keep six layers separate

For one identified transformation, keep these objects distinct:

| Layer | Object to keep distinct | Where to check it |
| --- | --- | --- |
| actual bounded change | one `U.Transformation` | A.3.4 identifies the continuing subject, extent, boundary conditions, before/during/after facts, and continuity rule |
| facts about the changed subject | relation occurrences and characteristic-state facts that actually hold | each subject pattern defines the participants, obtaining rule, and identity |
| reusable change semantics | one predicate-definition episteme when repeated use needs the same rule | A.3.4 or the subject pattern states how the listed base facts satisfy that predicate |
| transformation assertion | one C.2.1 episteme asserting that the transformation or base facts obtain | C.2.1 identifies claim content, exact EntityOfConcern, and effective reference scheme; scope and viewpoint remain neighboring relations |
| representation | formula, morphism, path, graph, diagram, trace, tuple, or state-plane expression | C.29 governs correspondence to independently recovered objects |
| evidence or evaluation result | an episteme used to support or evaluate the assertion | the measurement, evaluation, evidence, provenance, or assurance pattern defines or constrains that use |

A verbal predicate does not turn every obtaining relation occurrence into a transformation. Assignment, availability, installation, and temporal order can obtain without change. Conversely, one actual transformation may require several relation facts without being identical to any one of them.

Do not use a generic `transformationRelation` field. If an existing relation already states the needed fact, use it. Otherwise apply `A.6.RCD`: a local compound claim is available only when its exact base facts and admitted substrate are present; if a required basis is missing, preserve the applicable `A.6.RCD` stop. Introduce a reusable predicate-definition episteme only when repeated uses need the same rule. A new durable relation kind still needs its own obtaining and occurrence-identity law; a task, morphism, operation family, or verbal predicate cannot be inserted into one union-valued field.

#### A.3.4:4.4 - Add neighboring objects only for the claim being made

For each neighboring claim, identify the object it needs and state that object's relation to the transformation, changed subject, work, or later use.

| Claim being made | Pattern and boundary |
| --- | --- |
| reusable semantic way of doing | `A.3.1` governs `U.Method` |
| claim-bearing account of that way | `A.3.2` and C.2.1 govern `U.MethodDescription` |
| typed operation arguments or results | A.6.1 governs the exact operation declaration and application binding; these are not generic transformation inputs or outputs |
| intended work | `A.15.2` governs `U.WorkPlan` |
| performed work | `A.15.1` governs dated `U.Work` occurrences; for the named work/transformation pair, apply the routes and stops in `4.2.4` |
| transformation-flow location or composition | `E.18` governs selected `TransformationFlowStructure` |
| mathematical expression | `E.18.2` and `C.29` govern representation |
| dynamics model | `A.3.3` governs the episteme |
| evidence, measurement, evaluation, or assurance | apply the measurement, evaluation, evidence, provenance, or assurance pattern that states the support or judgment relation |
| description, view, publication, form, or carrier | C.2.1, `E.17`, and `E.24.PUB` keep the episteme, view membership, publication occurrence, publication form, and carrier distinct |
| `input`, `output`, `result`, `outcome`, `deliverable`, or `handoff` | name the participant and the relation actually claimed: method declaration, planned work, actual work, transformation, evaluation, commitment, delivery, acceptance, transfer, or receiving work. The source word is not a kind or universal slot. |

A declared post-state is part of a transformation description. An actual post-boundary state or changed entity is a fact about the subject. To call that entity or relation a result, name the later use, its participants, and the relation being asserted; acceptance, delivery, publication, and downstream effect remain separate. `U.Transformation` therefore has no generic `ResultRef` or `OutputConditionOrPortRefs` slot.

When the use needs an episteme about the transformation, identify it through C.2.1: exact claim content, the transformation or another subject as EntityOfConcern, and the effective reference scheme. Add scope, viewpoint, empirical grounding, edition, publication, or representation only when the use separately requires that relation.

#### A.3.4:4.5 - Neighboring Distinction Table

| Claim being made | Pattern to use |
| --- | --- |
| actual bounded transformation | `A.3.4 U.Transformation` |
| selected transformation-flow structure, locus, path, crossing, or flow valuation | `E.18`; A.3.4 still identifies each transformation occurrence |
| graph, algebra, morphism, path, tuple, or wiring expression | `E.18.2` and `C.29` for representation |
| semantic way of doing | `A.3.1 U.Method` |
| description of a way of doing | `A.3.2 U.MethodDescription` |
| state-space and transition-law episteme | `A.3.3 U.Dynamics` |
| reusable operation declaration or application binding | `A.6.1` |
| planned or dated work | `A.15.2 U.WorkPlan` or an `A.15.1` `U.Work` occurrence |
| positive temporal aspect or temporal-claim adequacy | `C.27.TA` or `C.27` |
| problem-to-work carry-through | `E.18.1`; it carries the identified objects |
| evidence, evaluation, assurance, gate, decision, source use, publication, delivery, acceptance, or transfer | use the pattern that defines that claim |

#### A.3.4:4.6 - Description And Publication Boundary

A method description, dynamics model, transformation diagram, transformation-flow structure description, dashboard, result record, source span, publication, or proof may describe a transformation or provide evidence for a use.

If the task is about the description, use `C.2.1`, `A.3.2`, `A.3.3`, `E.17`, `E.18`, or the applicable publication or source pattern. If the task is about the transformation, keep the description as a neighboring episteme or publication value.

#### A.3.4:4.7 - Formal Transformation And Project-World Realization

A morphism, constructive proof, or formal state transition can correspond to an actual transformation of a formal object within the selected formal substrate. The formula, morphism, or proof term is still its C.29 representation.

For a physical, clinical, organizational, architectural, documentary, or epistemic change, a formal expression may specify, predict, constrain, or compare the change. First identify the changed subject, boundary, and before/during/after facts. If a later claim says that dated `U.Work` caused, realized, or participated in that transformation, apply the routes and stops in `4.2.4` to the named pair.

#### A.3.4:4.8 - Multi-reading source phrase

Use this example when one phrase seems to name method, mechanism, formal construction, work, evidence, and transformation at once:

> "The workflow algorithm transforms the emergency-stop specification, and the proof shows the new plant boundary is safe."

Keep these objects separate:

- the workflow or algorithm may designate a `U.Method` or `U.MethodDescription`;
- the proof is a claim-bearing episteme using a declared formal substrate;
- when claim content changes, the earlier specification episteme and the later specification episteme are distinct C.2.1 identities; `EpistemeEditionRelation` relates them only when its historical-continuation predicate obtains;
- dated editing or review is a `U.Work` occurrence admitted under `A.15.1`;
- edition succession alone establishes no transformation of one continuing episteme. Open A.3.4 only for a separately continuing subject—such as a selected `U.PresentationCarrier` under `E.24.PUB` or a claim-bearing constituent organization—after naming its boundary, before/during/after facts, and continuity rule; otherwise stop without a transformation claim;
- if revision `U.Work` first constitutes the later episteme, open a separate `A.15.PROD` first-existence question: name the exact `productIdentitySpecification` episteme, the named applicability predicate or filled local claim that applies it to the candidate basis, subject context, and boundary, the `identityClosingWork`, and the work-to-change and change-to-identity predicates or local compound claims. If that specification continues an earlier specification, state the separate C.2.1 `EpistemeEditionRelation` only when its historical-continuation predicate obtains; without that relation, treat it as a non-continuing replacement and evaluate its applicability independently. Return the applicable `A.6.RCD` stop for either named connection that lacks its required basis;
- a plant change, safety evaluation, assurance claim, gate decision, and publication are separate objects and relations.

If only the proposed wording and proof are available, do not assert a project-world plant transformation. Different claim content gives two epistemes; test their `EpistemeEditionRelation`. Assert an A.3.4 specification-side transformation only for a separately continuing carrier or constituent organization with its boundary, before/during/after facts, and continuity rule. If the question instead concerns the later episteme's first existence, use `A.15.PROD` and stop when either direct connection lacks a basis. The proof can support an assertion only through its evidence or derivation use.

### A.3.4:5 - Archetypal Grounding

#### A.3.4:5.1 - Physical system change

A nuclear-plant team says that a revised operating method stabilized a temperature profile after a thermal-power change. **Result:** `CoolingLoopTransformation-7` is identified from the continuing cooling loop, stabilization interval, operating conditions, and before/during/after temperature facts. The method is `U.Method`; the control-law model is an episteme; measurements and the safety decision use their own patterns. This short case names no dated adjustment `U.Work` occurrence or work-to-change predicate, so it makes no such connection. If that claim is later needed, name both participants and apply `4.2.4`.

#### A.3.4:5.2 - Biological editing

A CRISPR project says that an editing protocol changed a DNA target while keeping off-target risk under a bound. **Result:** identify the biological transformation from the continuing DNA referent, edit interval, boundary conditions, and sequence facts. Keep the protocol description, biochemical mechanism, lab `U.Work`, sequence measurement, risk evaluation, acceptance verdict, and publication separate. This sketch names neither a lab-work/transformation pair nor a matching predicate, so it asserts no connection between them; apply `4.2.4` only if that later claim is needed. For phrases such as *edited sequence*, *lab output*, or *accepted result*, name the exact participant and relation needed by the receiving claim.

**Spontaneous non-agentive case — result:** `SeedlingFirstLeafUnfolding-B17 : U.Transformation` is an actual first-leaf unfolding without an actor, method, or work claim. The continuing subject is the already existing `Seedling-B17`. Its boundary runs from unfolding onset `t0` to the first stable full-expansion state `t1`; leaf-configuration and exposed-surface facts before, during, and after distinguish the episode under the stated growth conditions. The same-seedling rule permits ordinary cellular turnover and growth but excludes division, grafting, death, or replacement.

At this resolution the case asserts neither finer transformation parts nor partlessness. If a later use asks for an actor, apply A.3; if it asks for work, apply A.15.1 and then `4.2.4`. Otherwise keep the case non-agentive and do not open `A.15.PROD`.

#### A.3.4:5.3 - Specification repair

A safety specification is revised so that an emergency-stop boundary no longer permits two incompatible readings. **First result:** `EmergencyStopSpec-E1` and `EmergencyStopSpec-E2` are different C.2.1 epistemes because their claim content differs. `EpistemeEditionRelation(EmergencyStopSpec-E1, EmergencyStopSpec-E2)` may relate them when its historical-continuation predicate holds; neither is one continuing changed episteme.

A.3.4 may instead identify a change of `EmergencyStopSpec-Carrier-17 : U.PresentationCarrier` if `E.24.PUB` identifies the same carrier across the editing interval and the before/during/after borne-expression facts plus carrier-continuity rule are present. If the carrier identity, facts, or rule are missing, no carrier transformation follows. If editing `U.Work` first constituted `EmergencyStopSpec-E2`, name that work and the transformation by which the later identity closed. Apply `4.2.4` to the work-to-change pair, then apply `A.15.PROD` to the change-to-identity pair. Each connection needs a matching predicate or valid local compound basis; preserve the applicable `A.6.RCD` stop for either pair that lacks its required basis. The repair method, ambiguity-removal assertion, review result, and publication of the later episteme remain separate.

#### A.3.4:5.4 - Formal construction

A proof constructs a formal object and shows that a morphism preserves an invariant. **Result:** the proof supplies a formal object and an invariant-preservation claim. To establish one formal transformation within the declared substrate, identify a continuing formal subject under its identity rule and the actual differing facts across the ordered boundary. The proof term and morphism expression are representations; publishing the proof is another relation. If a later claim says that dated work realized the transformation, apply the routes and stops in `4.2.4` to the named pair.

#### A.3.4:5.5 - Architecture change

An architecture team performs dated architecture `U.Work`. During the same interval, a selected structure undergoes a separately identified transformation: an interlevel conflict decreases while a key architecture characteristic stays within bounds. **Result:** the work and transformation are both present, but this sketch does not connect them. If that connection is needed, name both participants and apply the routes and stops in `4.2.4`. Characteristic evaluation, decision, and publication remain separate.

#### A.3.4:5.6 - Functional transformer in a flow

When a sentence says that a system *transforms input to output* or *implements an algorithm*, split at least four questions: which system and role assignment are claimed; which subject actually changed; which participant, port, or operation bindings hold at the boundary; and where the transformation sits in the selected E.18 flow. Add a method or method description only if the sentence also makes that claim.

Examples:

- A pump can be the acting system while the actual transformation is the bounded pressure change of an identified fluid volume. Inlet and outlet pressure facts are characteristic-state and port facts; the pump curve is a model episteme.
- A warehouse can perform receiving `U.Work` while pallet-location and inventory-state changes occur. If a later use needs a work-to-change claim, name the pair and apply `4.2.4`. Orders and pallets keep their work, transfer, resource, or affected-subject relations.
- A neural-network block can participate in an activation transformation. Tensor-shape declarations, the attention method, dated inference work, benchmark evaluation, and architecture allocation stay separate and use their own patterns.


#### A.3.4:5.7 - Assembly changes before PumpSkid identity

Before asking whether PumpSkid 7 exists as one entity, identify the already existing base frame `BF-7`, pump unit `PU-7`, motor `MU-7`, junction enclosure `JE-7`, pipe spool `PS-7`, cable set `CS-7`, and their still-open mechanical, electrical, and fluid interfaces. `AssemblyConfiguration-7` is the A.22 selected structure made from those referents and their actual attachment, terminal, and flange-connection organization during assembly. It is not another name for a future PumpSkid 7 entity.

The mounting transformation changes the frame-to-pump and frame-to-motor attachment facts. The wiring transformation changes cable-to-terminal connections. The fluid-connection transformation changes spool-to-flange and seal facts. Identify each independently through its subject, extent, boundary conditions, before/during/after facts, and continuity rule. The change of `AssemblyConfiguration-7` can also be identified if those attachment, terminal, flange, and seal relations have declared participants and obtaining rules and the selected structure has its own boundary and continuity rule. Call that occurrence the configuration transformation. The other three changes do not become its components merely because they occur in the same assembly episode.

No current FPF relation in this case says that the mounting, wiring, fluid-connection, and configuration changes compose one transformation. Keep all four changes and stop before a part or whole-transformation claim. The result from `4.2.1` is `missing transformation-composition governor`; a proposed local compound claim also lacks an admitted derivation substrate.

Positive A.1 classification on that basis stops as well, because no accepted composition result supplies an exact whole candidate and all six constructive components required by A.1. The point at which a separate PumpSkid 7 identity rule first becomes true remains an entity-identity inception question; production completion, commissioning work, evidence, acceptance, and any B.2 whole-reidentification claim also remain separate.

### A.3.4:6 - Bias-Annotation

This pattern keeps the actual change separate from a composition question, holon classification, facts about the changed subject, method, work, flow structure, representation, assertion, evidence, evaluation, publication, production, and later use. It resists software narrowing, method-as-effect, model-as-authority, trace-as-law, formal-as-project-work, relation-verb-as-change, sampled-slice composition, blanket transformation holonhood, work-caused-change-as-production, and result-word-as-kind errors.

### A.3.4:7 - Conformance Checklist

| Check | Conformance statement |
| --- | --- |
| `CC-A34-1` | One continuing changed subject, temporal extent or formal ordering boundary, boundary conditions, before/during/after facts, and continuity or reidentification rule identify the transformation. Changed claim content instead yields two C.2.1 epistemes and a separate edition-relation question. |
| `CC-A34-2` | Actuality and transformation identity require the complete basis in 4.1, even when a method, plan, model, representation, or individual relation fact is available. |
| `CC-A34-3` | Every subject fact uses the pattern that defines its relation or characteristic; no union-valued `transformationRelation` field is used. |
| `CC-A34-4` | Method, method description, operation declaration or binding, plan, work, flow structure, representation, evidence, evaluation, and publication retain separate identities and relations. |
| `CC-A34-5` | A transformation assertion is a C.2.1 episteme about the actual transformation or exact base facts. |
| `CC-A34-6` | Time, rate, rhythm, duration, and ordering claims use `C.27.TA` and `C.27` without replacing transformation identity. |
| `CC-A34-7` | Use E.18 for the selected flow structure and C.29 for mathematical representation; ground actual transformation and work claims separately through A.3.4 and A.15.1. |
| `CC-A34-8` | Evidence, assurance, gate, acceptance, and decision authority are not inferred from the transformation or its description. |
| `CC-A34-9` | `input`, `output`, `result`, `outcome`, `deliverable`, and `handoff` remain wording cues until the reader names the participant and relation being asserted. |
| `CC-A34-10` | When performed `U.Work` is claimed to cause, realize, or participate in a transformation, the case applies an existing subject predicate, states one `A.6.RCD` disposition-2 local compound claim over named base facts, or preserves the applicable `A.6.RCD` stop for the pair. Co-occurrence and a shared subject are insufficient. |
| `CC-A34-11` | Every proposed component change and whole-configuration change is identified independently. Shared timing, referent, work, flow position, or representation establishes neither composition nor partlessness. |
| `CC-A34-12` | A use that needs positive transformation composition returns the parked result in 4.2.1. |
| `CC-A34-13` | A transformation is tested under A.1 only after a future accepted architecture independently supplies the exact candidate and all six A.1 constructive components; the current blocker, evaluation, assertion, evidence, currentness, receiving disposition, and B.2 remain separate. |
| `CC-A34-14` | When a production claim is current, test production-work participation, entity-identity inception, and production completion separately under `A.15.PROD`, using the exact work, work part, subject-identity facts, completion criterion, and direct effect facts. |

### A.3.4:8 - Common Anti-Patterns and How to Avoid Them

| Anti-pattern | Symptom | Repair |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Method name as change | "This method transforms X" is treated as an actual occurrence. | Name the continuing changed subject, boundary, and before/during/after facts; keep the method under A.3.1. |
| Process diagram as work | A workflow diagram is treated as enacted work. | Use `E.18` or `A.3.2` for the diagram; use `A.15.1` for dated work. |
| Dynamics model as permission | A transition law is used to approve action. | Keep `A.3.3` for the model; use evidence, gate, decision, and assurance patterns for use authority. |
| Temporal trend as intervention | A rate or rhythm trend is treated as proof of changed behavior under an intervention. | Use `C.27.TA` and `C.27`, then identify the continuing changed subject and its before/during/after facts separately. |
| Formal construction as work | A morphism or proof construction is treated as work performed in a project-world object. | Use `C.29` or the direct formal pattern for the mathematical relation; name realization and work separately. |
| Publication as transformation | A dashboard or report is treated as the changed state. | Use publication or source patterns for that artifact; identify the changed subject separately. |
| Sliced trajectory as composition | Samples, subintervals, method steps, work parts, concurrent changes, or flow nodes are declared components of one transformation by containment or proximity. | Independently identify each actual transformation. If the use needs a positive composition claim, return the parked blocker in 4.2.1; this edition does not choose its future architecture. Sampling or subdivision likewise supplies no evidence of indivisibility. |
| Resolution-level identification as partlessness | A change identified as one occurrence at the resolution chosen for the task is treated as necessarily atomic, indivisible, or partless, or as automatically composite and holonic. | Keep the independently identified `U.Transformation`; infer neither presence nor absence of finer parts. Do not make a positive composition or A.1 claim until a future accepted architecture supplies its basis. |
| Work-caused change as production | A change that follows `U.Work` is called a produced entity or completed production. | First close the named work/transformation connection through `4.2.4` or keep its blocker; then separately test production-work participation, first existence of the subject, and the applicable production-completion criterion under `A.15.PROD`. |

### A.3.4:9 - Consequences

- FPF gains one place to identify actual bounded transformations.
- Current-resolution identification remains cheap: one bounded change can be identified without settling its finer composition. This says neither that finer parts exist nor that they do not.
- An independently grounded change of a selected configuration remains usable without asserting whether nearby changes compose it or are its parts.
- A use that needs positive transformation composition receives the one parked result from 4.2.1: missing governor, and also missing substrate when it proposes a local derived or compound claim. No relation kind, signature, occurrence law, or definition identifier is minted here.
- If a future accepted architecture supplies an exact whole transformation and its construction facts, A.1 then applies its own six-component test; this edition supplies no positive transformation-holon classification.
- Each subject pattern keeps its own change, `U.Work`, and production facts. A work/transformation connection uses the existing-predicate or local-compound branch in `4.2.4`; otherwise preserve the applicable `A.6.RCD` stop for the named pair.
- E.18 can arrange or locate transformation occurrences in a selected flow structure.
- Ordinary result wording remains usable after the reader names the later use, its participants, and the relation being asserted; no universal transformation-result or production relation is introduced.
- Readers whose use stops with one actual transformation skip 4.2.1 and 4.2.3. Only a composition- or transformation-holon-dependent use opens that advanced branch, whose current result is the parked blocker.

### A.3.4:10 - Rationale

`U.Transformation` gives FPF one object for an actual bounded change. Identify it from the continuing subject, boundary, before/during/after facts, boundary conditions, and continuity or reidentification rule. Keep task, method, plan, work, operation family, predicate, representation, assertion, evidence, evaluation, publication, and later-use claims visible as separate objects rather than fields of the transformation.

An independently identified configuration transformation is not made into a whole with transformation parts merely because separately identified changes occur in the same episode or concern referents selected into that configuration. A positive composition claim still needs its governing rule and, for a compound claim, admitted derivation semantics.

A.1 remains an independent second test. If future accepted work supplies one exact whole transformation and all six A.1 construction facts, A.1 can judge that same entity. Until then, a whole or composite label, a trace, and the parked blocker supply no holonhood.

This separation also keeps production and result claims honest. A claim that `U.Work` caused or participated in a transformation needs the corresponding route in `4.2.4`; even a positive work-to-change claim does not establish production. A post-boundary entity may be the same continuing entity rather than a newly constituted one. Production-work participation, first existence, production completion, delivery, acceptance, and downstream effect each need their own participants, relation, and criterion.

### A.3.4:11 - SoTA-Echoing

A.3.4 uses four current source branches for four different questions.

| Source and practice answer | Use in A.3.4 | Adoption status and blocked overread |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Marletto, Deutsch, and Vedral, ["Tests of constructor theory"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2606.07352v1), 2026, arXiv edition `2606.07352v1`, reviews the current experimental-test branch of constructor theory in terms of possible and impossible tasks and constructors rather than ordinary program execution. | A.3.4:4.1 and 4.7 require an independently grounded actual bounded change even when a constructor-theory task or formal transformation is current; case 5.4 keeps the proof term or morphism expression as representation. | **Adapt.** Use the task/constructor distinction to discipline possibility and governing conditions. Reject the overread that a task, its description, a constructor label, or a formal expression establishes the actual occurrence, project-world realization, evidence, or permission; this source branch is not treated as consensus ontology for every change. |
| Deutsch and Marletto, ["Constructor theory of time"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08692v3), 2025, current arXiv edition `2505.08692v3` revised in 2026, shows within that current branch why duration and dynamics need an account distinct from task possibility. | A.3.4:4.1 identifies the occurrence through its extent or formal ordering boundary and actual subject facts; 4.4-4.5 use `C.27.TA` for temporal aspects, `C.27` for temporal-claim adequacy, and `A.3.3` for dynamics; case 5.1 keeps the control-law episteme separate from the cooling-loop change. | **Adapt.** Preserve the separation among task, duration, dynamics, and actual occurrence without importing constructor theory as FPF temporal ontology. Reject duration, a dynamics model, or a task specification as sufficient transformation identity. |
| Guizzardi, Benevides, Fonseca, Porello, Almeida, and Sales, ["UFO: Unified Foundational Ontology"](https://doi.org/10.3233/AO-210256), 2022, gives the current-state UFO account through distinct micro-theories that include events, situations, participation, causation, and change. | A.3.4:4.1 and 4.3-4.5 keep actual-change identity, subject facts, participation or work-to-change facts, causation, assertion, and representation as separate questions; case 5.6 applies that split to a system in a flow. | **Adopt the separation pressure; reject wholesale import.** FPF does not import UFO categories or infer event mereology from a model. Identify one `U.Transformation` at the resolution needed by the use; open participation, causation, work, or representation only through the pattern for that claim. |
| Borgo and Righetti, ["Towards Applied Constructional Ontology"](https://doi.org/10.3233/FAIA250480), 2025, argues that applied constructional ontology still requires explicit choices about mereology, dependence, identity, and application concerns. | A.3.4:4.2 and the PumpSkid case 5.7 independently identify the local changes, reject composition by timing or representation, and keep the positive architecture open. | **Adopt the demand for explicit choices; do not preselect their answer.** Temporal inclusion, graph adjacency, a shared referent, a construction label, or a selected structure supplies neither transformation composition nor part identity. This source does not decide whether FPF should later use a generic relation, subject-specific relations, bounded local claims, or continued non-admission. |

### A.3.4:12 - Relations

- **Builds on:** `A.1` for the independent holon criterion, `A.6.RCD` for the applicable relation-claim routes and stops, `C.2.1` for blocker and assertion epistemes, and `A.7` for category separation.
- **Coordinates with:** `A.3` when the use makes an acting-system claim; `A.11` for parsimony; `A.14` and `C.13` for structural mereology without transformation-composition overread; `A.22` for a selected changed structure; `A.3.1`, `A.3.2`, `A.3.3`, `A.6.1`, `A.15.1`, `A.15.2`, and `A.15.PROD` for method, dynamics, operation, work, and production questions; `E.18`, `E.18.1`, `C.32.P2S`, `C.27.TA`, `C.27`, `C.29`, `A.10`, `B.3`, `G.11`, and `B.2`; and the work-to-change, evidence, evaluation, gate, decision, source-use, production, delivery, acceptance, transfer, assurance, and publication patterns for those claims.
