## A.2.2 - U.Capability - System Ability Envelope and Measures
> **Status:** Stable

`U.Capability` is the FPF object for "can do within bounds".

Use this pattern when a project claim says that a person, team, machine, software service, organization, composite cell, or other system can produce a kind of result, perform a class of work, or meet a performance threshold. The claim is about a holder's capability instance, not about who is assigned, which method is described, which work occurred, or what was promised to another party.

**Primary EntityOfConcern.** The EntityOfConcern is `U.Capability`: an `E.24.UK`-admitted dependent durable U-kind name for holder-dependent capability instances. An individual `U.Capability` instance is a holder-dependent concrete governed object of a named `U.System`, recognized as that system's ability to perform a work family or produce a result class within a declared envelope, measure set, qualification window, and currentness condition. A statement, report row, certification, evidence relation, source-use relation, dashboard display, or currentness assessment about that instance is a neighboring governed record or relation, not the capability instance itself.

**Primary working reader.** A manager, architect, engineer, safety assessor, scheduler, or model author who needs to decide whether a holder can be used for a Work claim, Method step, service promise, or architecture move without smuggling a system-role kind or assignment, MethodDescription, past Work, evidence, or quality wording into the capability instance.

**First useful move.** Ask: who is the holder system, what work family or result class is the ability about, under what envelope, with what declared measures, during which qualification window, and which separate statement, evidence relation, source-use relation, or currentness assessment currently supports reliance on that capability?

**What goes wrong if missed.** A system-role label or assignment becomes a hidden proof of ability, a MethodDescription is treated as if it can perform Work, a phrase such as “the system possesses algorithm A” is taken to admit an unspecified episteme as `U.MethodDescription`, a single successful run is generalized into a stable ability, or a promise is made without a measured capability behind it.

**What this buys.** Capability becomes checkable and reusable: a Work-admission claim can test the exact system-role assignment, `SystemRoleAssignmentStateRelation`, Method-side admission conditions, and capability thresholds separately.

**Not this pattern when.**

- If the current claim is which admitted System is assigned to an exact local system-role kind, use `A.2.1`.
- If the current claim is whether that assignment is in an enactable state, use `A.2.5`.
- If the current claim is a local system-role kind, its classification, description, designation, exact assignment, relation structure, or bundle, use `A.2`, `A.2.1`, `F.4`, `F.18`, or `A.2.7` for that exact object.
- If the current claim is a way of doing, use `A.3.1`; if it is an episteme describing that way, use `A.3.2`.
- If the current claim is dated performed work or planned work, use `A.15`, `A.15.1`, or `A.15.2`.
- If the current claim is a promise to others, use the promise-content and commitment patterns.
- If the current claim is evidence, source, status, assurance, publication, or description use of an episteme, use the direct episteme-use pattern. Do not make the episteme a capability holder.
- If the current claim is one measured aspect with a declared scale, use `U.Characteristic` through `C.16.P`, `A.19`, and the applicable characteristic or Scale pattern.
- If the current claim is a composite quality family such as availability, resilience, security, or maintainability, use `C.25` Q-Bundle.
- If the current claim is an architecture-characteristic starter head, project criteria row, architecture eval reading, or architecture-description concern, use `C.32.HCS`, `C.32.ACS`, `C.32.ACE`, or `C.30` as applicable.

### A.2.2:1 - Problem Frame

These ordinary sentences make different claims about welding:

- "The welding robot is the welder on this line."
- "The welding robot can weld seam type W at 12 seams per minute."
- "The welding procedure says how to weld seam type W."
- "The robot welded batch B at 10:20."
- "The supplier promises 12 seams per minute."

Only the second sentence can support a `U.Capability` instance when the holder, Work family, envelope, measures, and currentness conditions are recoverable. The sentence itself is a statement about the capability instance. The others may state a local system-role assignment, MethodDescription, performed Work, or promise content. When FPF collapses them, project reasoning becomes brittle:

1. **System-role assignment becomes fake ability.** “Assigned as verifier” is treated as “able to verify”.
2. **Method description becomes fake ability.** A recipe or algorithm is treated as sufficient evidence of the holder's ability.
3. **Past work becomes fake ability.** One successful work occurrence is treated as stable capacity.
4. **Promise content becomes fake ability.** A service promise hides the real system envelope and measured bounds.
5. **Description becomes fake holder.** A standard, report, model card, or dashboard is said to "have capability" because it is useful in a capability argument.
6. **Unbounded ability becomes unreviewable.** "Can machine titanium" does not name conditions, measures, version, calibration, or currentness.

### A.2.2:2 - Kind and Boundary

`U.Capability` is retained as a dependent durable U-kind name under `E.24.UK`. A concrete `U.Capability` instance is the holder-dependent capability instance of a named `U.System`; its identity is grounded by the holder, work family or result class, envelope, measure set, qualification window, and currentness condition. The statement that asserts the ability, the evidence that supports reliance, and the fit predicate that tests work admission are separately governed records or relations rather than the `U.Capability` instance.

SupportAndUseReferencesAroundCapability:

  EvidenceRelationRefs?: governed evidence relations that support reliance
  SourceUseRelationRefs?: governed source-use relations used to justify or constrain the statement
  CurrentnessAssessmentRefs?: dated assessment relations evaluating the currentness condition
  CapabilityFitConditionRefs?: admission predicates or gate relations that test this instance for a use
```

**CapabilityHolderRef.** The holder is an admitted `U.System`: a physical, cyber, socio-technical, organizational, team, composite-cell, deployed-software, or other System satisfying A.1 for this claim.

**WorkFamilyOrResultClassRef.** The ability is about a class of work the holder system can perform or a result class it can produce. The envelope may cite the exact `U.Method` that prospective Work occurrences would enact, or a separately identified `U.MethodDescription` whose claims constrain the capability use. For a candidate episteme, apply A.3.2 before calling it a `U.MethodDescription`.

**CapabilityEnvelope.** The envelope states the bounded conditions under which the ability holds: input range, environment, resources, configuration, system version, calibration state, staffing composition, access constraints, safety limits, or other current conditions.

**CapabilityMeasureSet.** The measures state achieved or required bounds, with their units, scales, tolerances, and success predicates, for declared characteristics such as reliability, throughput, latency, precision, or defect rate. Identify which bounds the holder is claimed to meet and which the intended work requires; use those as the two sides of the capability-fit comparison. A measure may cite a `U.Characteristic`, Q-Bundle slot, or architecture-characteristic criteria row as an input for a capability-fit check, but that characteristic, Q-Bundle, or architecture row does not become the capability.

**QualificationWindow.** Capability is stable enough to plan with but not timeless. The instance may depend on software version, calibration horizon, team training state, wear, operating season, regulatory state, or other conditions affecting currentness.

**CapabilityStatementRefs.** A `CapabilityStatement` is a governed episteme or publication-side record that says a capability instance exists, describes its holder, envelope, measures, and window, or cites it for planning.

**EvidenceRelationRefs and SourceUseRelationRefs.** Evidence, tests, certifications, prior work summaries, simulations, audit records, standards, and model results can justify a capability statement through direct evidence or source-use relations.

**CurrentnessAssessmentRefs.** A currentness assessment is a dated assessment relation saying whether the capability instance remains usable under its qualification window and current conditions. `CapabilityCurrentnessCondition` states what must remain true; an assessment evaluates that condition.

**CapabilityFitConditionRefs.** A capability-fit condition is an admission predicate, threshold condition, or gate relation that tests a holder capability and any declared characteristic, Q-Bundle, or architecture-characteristic inputs against a current local system-role-kind classification, exact assignment, Method step, WorkPlan, Work occurrence, ClaimScope, qualification window, or gate need. Unless a separate E.24.UK admission is written, it is not a `U.*` kind.

**Neighboring-term boundary.** When a neighboring pattern uses `U.WorkScope`, recover the set-valued condition part of `CapabilityEnvelope`: the inputs, environment, resources, configuration, and assumptions against which an intended work slice is checked. When it uses `U.WorkMeasures`, recover `CapabilityMeasureSet`. `JobSlice` names the intended work slice for a work-admission check. `QualificationWindow` names the temporal window used to judge currentness of the capability instance. These are neighboring governed terms, not substitute names for `U.Capability`.



### A.2.2:3 - Positive Solution

Use `U.Capability` when the object under discussion is the holder's ability to achieve a result class within a declared envelope and measure set.

Minimal capability instance:

```text
ConcreteCapabilityInstance:
  holder: U.System
  canDo: WorkFamilyOrResultClass
  envelope: CapabilityEnvelope
  measures: CapabilityMeasureSet
  qualificationWindow: QualificationWindow
  currentnessCondition: CapabilityCurrentnessCondition
```

Separate supporting record:

```text
CapabilityStatementRecord:
  describedCapabilityRef: ConcreteCapabilityInstance
  statementSourceRef:
  evidenceOrSourceUseRefs:
  currentnessAssessmentRefs?:
```

Plain sentence forms (choose one for the current claim):

```text
<System> can perform <work family>
within <envelope>
at <measures>
during <qualification window>,
with <evidence or source-use relation>.
```

```text
<System> can produce <result class>
within <envelope>
at <measures>
during <qualification window>,
with <evidence or source-use relation>.
```

A sentence in either form states the capability claim and may be published.

### A.2.2:4 - Separation From Neighboring Values

| Source wording | Recovered FPF values |
|---|---|
| “Engineer role can approve the design.” | Treat bare *role* as an E.10.ROLE trigger. If it means classification, recover local kind `EngineerSystemRole` and a C.3.2 judgment for an admitted System. If assignment identity matters, name the assignment occurrence and its declared `U.SystemRoleAssignment` species. Do not infer permission, capability, action, responsibility, or approval Work from either claim; add `U.Capability` only for a measured and qualified ability of the holder System, and use the permission and performed-Work relations when those claims are made. |
| “The robot is assigned as welder.” | Name an assignment occurrence with the robot as holder and its declared `U.SystemRoleAssignment` species, whose assigned-kind position has local domain `WelderSystemRoleKindDomain`; the occurrence supplies `WelderSystemRole` as the value admitted by that domain. Add `U.Capability` only if the claim also says that the robot can meet a welding envelope and measures. |
| "The solver has the scheduling algorithm." | First identify what the possession phrase claims: a deployed-software relation, a capability statement about the solver system, a reference to exact `U.Method`, or a candidate claim-bearing episteme. Apply `A.3.2` only to the last candidate; it is `U.MethodDescription` only when its exact `EntityOfConcern` is one admitted Method and at least one substantive claim says how that Method is done. The phrase alone establishes none of these. |
| "The report has evidence capability." | Recover the report's evidence-use relation. A separate capability claim needs a system that can perform evidential work. |
| "The team did one successful run." | `U.Work` occurrence; capability only after a separate capability instance is established with envelope, measures, and currentness. |
| "We promise five-day close." | Promise content and commitment; capability is the holder-dependent capability instance that makes the promise credible. |
| "The architecture provides resilience capability." | Architecture-characteristic or Q-Bundle material under `C.30`, `C.32.HCS`, `C.32.ACS`, and `C.25`; add `U.Capability` only when a named holder system has a capability instance to produce or maintain a result class within a capability envelope. Resilience characteristics may constrain a capability-fit condition; they are not capability by name. |

### A.2.2:5 - Work-Admission Use

A Method step or Work claim may require both an exact system-role assignment and capability conditions.

```text
WorkAdmissionCheck:
  systemRoleAssignmentCurrent: A.2.1 direct species under U.SystemRoleAssignment
  systemRoleAssignmentStateAdmitsWork: A.2.5
  methodStepRequires: A.3.1 or A.3.2
  holderCapabilityRef: A.2.2
  capabilityFitCondition: admission predicate over declared capability measures and any named characteristic, Q-Bundle, or architecture-characteristic inputs
  performedWorkRecord: A.15.1 after execution
```

The checks are separate:

- one `U.SystemRoleAssignment` species defines the holder and assigned-kind participant meanings, the local system-role-kind domain, and any other participant meaning that changes the assignment predicate or occurrence identity; an occurrence supplies the holder System and other values for the case, and neither species nor occurrence establishes capability or Work;
- `SystemRoleAssignmentStateRelation` says whether that assignment satisfies the selected state predicate over the required window;
- one exact `U.Method` supplies the method-side condition, while an independently admitted `U.MethodDescription` or work-admission episteme may state the capability threshold used by the check;
- capability names the holder system's ability within the envelope, measure set, and window;
- capability-fit condition tests whether that instance meets the current threshold or gate need;
- after execution, A.13 first recovers the exact actual performer and A.15.1 independently admits the dated Work occurrence; F.6 `performedUnderAssignment(W, RA)` is added only when this capability account or its receiving use expressly consumes precise assignment-bound attribution through the same obtaining A.13 assignment, while actual `enactsMethod(W, M)` separately relates the Work to the exact Method;

Do not put the threshold into the local system-role-kind name.

### A.2.2:6 - Worked Cases

#### A.2.2:6.1 - Manufacturing Cell

The capability instance is separate from the assignment; a statement or record may describe it:

```text
ConcreteCapabilityInstance:
  holder: RobotArm_A
  canDo: Weld_MIG_v3 seam family
  envelope: steel grades S235-S355, ambient 18-30 C, argon mix 92-95 percent, torch T-MIG-07
  measures: bead width 6.0 mm plus or minus 0.2 mm, throughput up to 12 seams per minute, defect rate below 0.5 percent
  qualificationWindow: calibration valid through 2026-09-30
  currentnessCondition: time of use is within the qualification window, calibration remains valid, and the current configuration meets the declared envelope
SupportAndUseReferencesAroundCapability:
  evidenceOrSourceUse: latest welding test report and calibration source relation
```

`WeldingShiftAssignment` is a declared species under `U.SystemRoleAssignment`. Under A.2.1 its signature defines the holder and assigned-kind participant meanings and uses `WelderSystemRoleKindDomain` as the local assigned-kind domain; it adds another participant only if that participant changes the assignment predicate or occurrence identity. One occurrence has `RobotArm_A` as holder, `WelderSystemRole` as the assigned-kind value admitted by that domain, and an extent lasting while the predicate obtains without interruption for the same participants. The assertion has exact claim content, EntityOfConcern, and effective ReferenceScheme; a ClaimScope, selected slice, interval, or qualification window is stated separately when it changes interpretation or validity. None of those values is another assignment participant. A separate Work or system-locus relation may place intended or performed welding at `AssemblyLine_2026` when that relation obtains.

If a Method step requires an obtaining `WeldingShiftAssignment` whose local kind is `WelderSystemRole` and bead-width tolerance below 0.2 mm, the assignment and capability are both checked. The declared ±0.2 mm bound does not establish the stricter tolerance, so this capability statement alone cannot support admission of the step.

**Shared boundary case — Robot-7 possesses an inspection algorithm.** `InspectionReleaseAssignment` is a declared species under `U.SystemRoleAssignment`; under A.2.1 its signature defines the holder and assigned-kind participant meanings and uses `InspectorSystemRoleKindDomain` as the local assigned-kind domain. Occurrence `InspectionAssignment-17` has `Robot-7` as holder and `InspectorSystemRole` as the assigned-kind value admitted by that domain. This simple species declares no taxonomy, reference-scheme, generic-context, or interval participant. An assertion about the occurrence may cite `MaintenanceRoles-2026`, `Maintenance-Scheme-A`, and the candidate inspection interval as interpretation and description content.

`Robot7-TurbineInspectionCapability-2026` is the separate holder-dependent capability instance for turbine-inspection Work within its declared sensor, calibration, input, measure, and qualification bounds. A statement that Robot-7 “possesses inspection algorithm A” does not by itself identify that capability instance, Method `TurbineInspection@Maintenance-2026`, a deployed-software relation, or a MethodDescription episteme.

Dispatch the phrase by claim: use A.2.2 only for the bounded ability; A.3.1 for the Method; a deployed-software or possession relation when that is the claim; and A.3.2 for candidate episteme `TurbineInspectionProcedure-v3` only after its `EntityOfConcern` resolves to that Method and one substantive claim says how it is done.

Assignment and capability still do not prove execution. If `InspectionWork-17` actually occurs, A.13 first recovers `Robot-7` as the exact actual performer through obtaining `InspectionAssignment-17`, and A.15.1 independently admits the Work. Because this example expressly states assignment-bound attribution, F.6 afterward establishes `performedUnderAssignment(InspectionWork-17, InspectionAssignment-17)` through that same assignment; F.6 identifies neither assignment nor performer, and failed attribution leaves the Work intact. The Work occurrence separately stands in `enactsMethod(InspectionWork-17, TurbineInspection@Maintenance-2026)`.

#### A.2.2:6.2 - Software Service as Deployed System

`PlannerService_v4` is a deployed system. It may have capability to generate job-shop schedules for 50-500 jobs and 5-40 machines, with benchmark optimality above 0.95 and latency below 20 ms in `PlantScheduling_2026`.

The algorithm paper and method description are not the capability. The deployed system has the capability only while its version, dependencies, input range, and operational measurements satisfy the declared currentness condition; a benchmark report or model card is support for a statement about that instance.

#### A.2.2:6.3 - Organization or Team

`FinanceDept` can close books for eight legal entities under IFRS with ERP v12, staffing at or above six qualified people, and close duration below five business days. That is a capability of the organizational system.

The monthly-close service promise is a promise-content claim. The actual close for March 2026 is performed Work. Staff assignments and their `SystemRoleAssignmentStateRelation` occurrences are neighboring claims. The capability instance keeps the department's ability visible and measurable; the management report describing it is an episteme about that instance.

#### A.2.2:6.4 - Episteme Anti-Case

"ISO 26262 has safety capability" is not a capability statement about a holder-dependent capability instance. The standard is an episteme used as source, requirement, or assurance input. A safety engineering team or toolchain may have a capability to perform safety-case work using that standard within a declared envelope.

### A.2.2:7 - Capability Currentness and Lowering

Lower or reopen a capability instance, or lower reliance on a statement about it, when any of these changes:

- the holder system changes composition, version, calibration, staffing, training state, toolchain, or environment;
- the envelope no longer covers the intended work slice;
- measures no longer meet the required threshold;
- the qualification window expires or becomes contested;
- evidence, source-use, test, audit, or simulation relations become stale or are reclassified, lowering the support or currentness assessment rather than becoming the capability;
- the method or method description changes the required capability threshold;
- the system-role assignment or its state relation changes, causing a Work-admission claim to fail even while the holder retains the capability;
- a composite holder changes dependency conditions.

Repair the smallest object that changed. A stale calibration window lowers the capability currentness assessment and may lower reliance on the capability instance; it does not rewrite the local system-role kind. A failed system-role assignment lowers Work admission; it does not by itself lower the holder's measured ability. A stale report lowers a statement or evidence relation before it lowers the capability instance itself.

### A.2.2:8 - Composite Capability

A composite system may have a capability that none of its parts has alone. Treat the composite as the holder.

```text
ConcreteCapabilityInstance:
  holder: Cell_3
  canDo: place 12 PCB per minute
  envelope: feeder, vision, head, controller, and operator conditions
  measures: placement tolerance, throughput, fault rate
  qualificationWindow: current configuration and calibration window
  dependencyNotes: feeder and vision subsystem conditions
```

The concrete capability instance is asserted for `Cell_3`, not for every part. Dependencies may be named, but the bounded capability claim is about the composite holder.

### A.2.2:9 - Checklist

| Check | Question |
|---|---|
| `CC-A2.2-01` | Is the holder an admitted `U.System` under A.1 for this claim? |
| `CC-A2.2-02` | Does the capability instance name the work family or result class? |
| `CC-A2.2-03` | Does the capability instance name the envelope: inputs, environment, configuration, resources, constraints, or conditions? |
| `CC-A2.2-04` | Does the measure set bind measurable bounds to units, scales, thresholds, predicates, declared `U.Characteristic` values, Q-Bundle slots, or architecture-characteristic rows without making those inputs the capability? |
| `CC-A2.2-05` | Does the capability instance name the qualification window and currentness condition, while dated currentness assessments remain separate relations? |
| `CC-A2.2-06` | Are statements, evidence, source-use relations, certifications, reports, dashboards, and currentness assessments expressed as neighboring support records or relations, not as `U.Capability` or capability holders? |
| `CC-A2.2-07` | Are the exact system-role assignment, `SystemRoleAssignmentStateRelation`, Method-side admission or fit condition, performed Work, and promise content kept separate? |
| `CC-A2.2-08` | For Work admission, are the exact system-role assignment, capability instance, and capability-fit predicate all visible when all are current? |
| `CC-A2.2-09` | For composite holders, is the capability stated at the whole whose ability is being claimed? |
| `CC-A2.2-10` | Are lowering and reopen conditions local enough to change only the affected capability instance, statement, evidence relation, currentness assessment, or fit predicate? |
| `CC-A2.2-11` | When wording says that a holder possesses an algorithm, did the use dispatch separately to capability, exact Method, deployed-software or possession relation, or candidate episteme, and apply A.3.2's exact-Method `EntityOfConcern` plus substantive-claim threshold before admitting `U.MethodDescription`? Does only the admitted holder system perform dated Work under exact assignment while the Work separately enacts the Method? |

### A.2.2:10 - Anti-Patterns and Repairs

| Anti-pattern | Symptom | Repair |
|---|---|---|
| System-role-kind-as-capability | “The inspector role can detect this defect.” | Treat bare *role* through E.10.ROLE; retain the exact local system-role kind and any independently obtaining assignment, then state capability for the holder System only when the bounded capability instance and current support justify it. |
| Assignment-as-capability | "Assigned, therefore able." | Use A.2.1 for assignment and A.2.2 for the holder-dependent capability instance. |
| Capability attributed to a procedure | "The procedure has capability" | Keep capability with the holder system. |
| Unjustified `U.MethodDescription` admission | Treating "the solver has the algorithm" as sufficient for `U.MethodDescription` admission. | Treat procedure or algorithm wording as a cue to one candidate episteme only when that is the actual object; admit it as `U.MethodDescription` through A.3.2 only after its exact `EntityOfConcern` is an admitted Method and a substantive claim says how that Method is done. |
| Work-as-capability | "We did it once, so we can." | Keep the work occurrence; add a separate capability instance only when envelope, measures, and currentness are justified. |
| Promise-as-capability | "The SLA is our capability." | Use promise content or commitment for what is offered; capability is the internal measured ability that makes the promise credible. |
| Episteme-as-holder | "The report has assessment capability." | Use evidence, source, status, or assessment relation for the episteme; capability holder remains a system. |
| Unbounded capability | "The tool can machine titanium." | Add material grade, tolerances, feed range, environment, version, qualification window, and measurement evidence. |
| Capability threshold in system-role-kind name | `HighPrecisionWelderSystemRole` hides a measured threshold. | Keep the system-role-kind name free of the threshold; put precision in the Method-side admission or fit condition and the holder capability instance. |
| Characteristic-as-capability | "Low latency is a capability." | Use `U.Characteristic` with declared scale for latency; add `U.Capability` only when a named holder can produce a result class within an envelope that includes the latency measure. |
| Q-Bundle-as-capability | "Resilience is our capability." | Use `C.25` for the composite quality family; cite a capability only when a currentness assessment supports reliance on a holder-dependent capability instance and a fit predicate tests the relevant bundle slot. |
| Architecture-row-as-capability | "Maintainability row gives capability." | Use `C.32.ACS` for the architecture-characteristic criteria row; it may constrain a capability-fit condition but is not `U.Capability`. |

### A.2.2:11 - Consequences

**Benefits.**

- Planning separates "can do" from "is assigned now".
- Method steps can name capability thresholds without putting extra meaning into system-role-kind names.
- Work records can be judged against the capability instance and fit predicate current at the time of work.
- The internal ability and measured envelope supporting a promise are explicit.
- Composite-system ability can be stated at the right holder instead of scattered across parts.

**Costs.**

- Capability tables need envelope, measures, and currentness fields.
- Teams need to stop using system-role labels or assignments as shortcuts for ability.
- Some old "function", "service", "process", and "algorithm" sentences need kind recovery before they can be used in FPF.

These distinctions let practitioners check authorization, ability, method, and performance separately.

### A.2.2:12 - SoTA-Echoing

| Current practice or research line | What FPF takes | Practical implication |
|---|---|---|
| Capability-based planning in defense and enterprise architecture keeps ability, mission need, activities, Systems, and portfolio planning separate. | The `U.Capability` name governs holder-dependent capability instances with envelope and measures. | A capability instance can be compared across candidate Systems without selecting the implementation too early. |
| Analyzable architecture and capability-planning practice separates the system whose ability is claimed from architecture descriptions, requirements, measures, and evidence. | Capability instances name holder, result class, envelope, measures, and qualification window; descriptions, statements, evidence, and currentness assessments remain separate values. | The reader can see which object changed when a requirement, holder, measure, source, or operating condition changes. |
| Current uncertainty and verification work for cyber-physical and autonomous systems treats operating conditions and currentness as first-class modeling concerns. | Qualification windows and lowering triggers are part of the capability instance boundary; evidence, source-use refs, and currentness assessments support or lower reliance without becoming capability. | A stale calibration, changed version, or out-of-envelope input lowers the currentness assessment or capability instance locally. |
| Modern access-control and zero-trust practice separates the acting system, assignment, current assignment-state relation, policy decision, and resource action. | An assignment or assignment-state relation may satisfy an entry condition, but neither grants capability. | “Allowed to act” and “able to achieve the measured result” remain separate checks. |

Source-currentness note: DoDAF and TOGAF are used here as stable capability-planning lineage, not as the full current frontier. Current pressure comes from analyzable architecture, uncertainty-aware engineering, stakeholder-context formalization, and model integration. The NIST zero-trust line is used only for the split between current authorization and measured ability.

### A.2.2:13 - Relations

| Pattern | Relation |
|---|---|
| `A.1` | Supplies holon and system grounding. |
| `A.2` | Use for exact local system-role kinds and C.3.2 classification judgments; neither carries capability by label. |
| `A.2.1` | Use for directly declared species under `U.SystemRoleAssignment`; an assignment's holder System may separately have capability. |
| `A.2.5` | Use for `SystemRoleAssignmentStateRelation` and Work-admitting state conditions; assignment state is not capability. |
| `A.2.7` | Use for `SystemRoleKindRelationStructure`; admission substitution or incompatibility among system-role kinds does not create capability. |
| `A.3.1` | Governs `U.Method`; method may require capability thresholds. |
| `A.3.2` | Governs membership of one already identified claim-bearing episteme in `U.MethodDescription`; algorithm, procedure, or possession wording is only a cue until the exact admitted Method `EntityOfConcern` and substantive way-of-doing claim are recovered. An admitted method description may separately state required capability. |
| `A.3.3` | Governs `U.Dynamics`, the state-space and transition-law episteme; dynamics may explain or predict capability but is not the holder-dependent capability instance. |
| `A.15`, `A.15.1`, `A.15.2` | Govern method, plan, and performed work alignment; capability is one input to work admission, not work itself. |
| `A.6.5` | Supplies SlotSpec discipline for capability relation fields and capability-use relations. |
| `A.6.F` | Repairs function and functionality wording that may hide capability, method, work, math function, or functional-architecture claims. |
| `A.6.RSIR` | Use it to recover relation, signature, interface, system-role, participation, declaration-position, and slot wording before capability repair when the source sentence is mixed; use E.10.ROLE to select the branch for bare *role*. |
| `C.27.TA`, `C.27` | Use C.27.TA when a positive temporal aspect of capability—currentness, window, rhythm, or drift—is itself relied on; use C.27 for temporal-claim adequacy. |
| `C.2.1`, `A.10`, `B.3`, `C.28`, `F.10`, `E.17` | Govern episteme, evidence, assurance, counterfactual, status, and publication-use relations that may justify or qualify a statement or reliance use about a capability instance. |
| `C.16.P`, `A.19` | Govern characteristic, scale, and characteristic-space recovery when capability measures depend on declared measured aspects. |
| `C.25` | Governs composite quality families and Q-Bundles that may supply slots for capability-fit checks. |
| `C.30`, `C.32.HCS`, `C.32.ACS`, `C.32.ACE` | Govern architecture-characteristic material, project criteria rows, and eval readings that may constrain capability use without becoming `U.Capability`. |
| Promise-content and commitment patterns | Govern outward promise and commitment relations; a promise or commitment claim may cite a capability relation, but capability does not become promise or commitment. |

### A.2.2:14 - Excluded Objects

Do not use `U.Capability` as the current object for:

- local system-role kind, direct system-role assignment, `SystemRoleAssignmentStateRelation`, structure of relations among system-role kinds, or system-role-kind description;
- method, method family, method description, or algorithm description;
- work plan, work occurrence, run record, or measurement trace;
- evidence graph, source record, model card, standard, report, dashboard, publication, or specification-use relation;
- promise content, commitment, permission, authority relation, or policy decision;
- `U.Characteristic`, scale row, coordinate, score, metric, indicator, or threshold;
- `C.25` Q-Bundle, quality-family label, mechanism, status, or evidence slot;
- architecture-characteristic starter head, project criteria row, eval program, eval reading, selected-structure adequacy claim, or architecture-description concern;
- capability-fit predicate, gate, admission relation, or work-entry readiness record;
- structural part, module, interface, port, or functional structure unless the current claim is the ability of a holder system expressed through that structure.

These values may be related to a capability instance, a statement about it, or a fit check over it. Name the neighboring value, record, relation, or predicate through its own governing pattern when that neighboring claim is current.
