## A.2.4 - Episteme Evidence-Use and Status-Use Relations

> **Type:** Boundary and relation-use pattern
> **Status:** Stable
> **Normativity:** Normative

### A.2.4:1 - Problem Frame

Use this pattern when an episteme, such as a report's content, is being used as evidence, source, status bearer, assurance input, or causal-use input for a claim.

Use it when the working question is:

* which episteme is being used;
* which claim, theory statement, status assertion, use, or causal-use question the episteme is being used for;
* which effective source scheme (when interpretation depends on it), ClaimScope, grounding holon, polarity, relevance window, assurance use, weight model, and provenance constraints are current;
* whether source wording such as "evidence role", "status role", "standard role", or "the report plays a role" hides an evidence-use, status-use, source-use, publication-use, assurance-use, gate-use, or causal-use relation;
* whether the evidence-use or status-use relation is sufficiently specified for the intended reliance, or only enough for orientation, source-finding, a reversible probe, or a narrowed use.

**Primary EntityOfConcern.** The `EntityOfConcern` is the evidence-use relation or status-use relation around an episteme.

**First useful move.** Name the exact episteme and the claim or governed status for which it is being used. When the intended use needs more than this classification, use §4.6 to recover the additional claim and its direct governing pattern.

**What goes wrong if missed.** Producing or evaluating work is attributed to the document itself, a dataset is treated as if it were classified under a work-facing system-role kind, a dashboard status is used as permission, a proof is used outside its theory-version fence, or a simulation-only counterfactual output is relabelled as realized causal evidence.

**What this buys.** A cheap first-use classification that identifies the episteme and its evidence-use or status-use relation. The further questions in §4.6 are answered through their direct patterns.

**Not this pattern when.** Use A.13 to identify the actual performer and A.15.1 to admit performed Work independently. If the current result must also identify the assignment under which that Work was performed, check it separately through F.6. Use A.6.1 for actual bindings, and use the exact formal, measurement, causal, diagnostic, conformance, comparison, selection, acceptance, gate, permission, commitment, system-role-kind, assignment, or decision pattern for its local result. Use C.2.1 for the result episteme, A.10/G.6 for provenance and bounded reliance, G.11 for currentness, B.3 for assurance, F.10 or another direct status pattern for status, and E.17 for publication. A.2.4 classifies only the episteme's first evidence-use or status-use.

### A.2.4:2 - Problem

Source text may use `U.EvidenceRole` or another evidence-like *role* label for a real need: an episteme can be used as evidence for a claim under an effective source scheme and exact ClaimScope, with polarity, time, assurance use, weight, and provenance constraints. Treat those spellings as source-word triggers. The FPF repair states an evidence-use relation; it does not classify the episteme under a system-role kind or place it in a `U.SystemRoleAssignment`.

Unresolved role-shaped wording can lead to the following failures:

1. **Episteme-as-holder drift.** A paper, proof, dataset, standard, or dashboard cell is treated as if it were classified under a work-facing system-role kind or filled the holder position of an assignment.
2. **Evidence-word ontology drift.** `ModelFitEvidenceRole`, `MeasurementEvidenceRole`, or `AxiomaticProofRole` is treated as a kind merely because the source label ends in *Role*, instead of being resolved to an evidence-use relation classification or local evidence-use label.
3. **Claim relation collapse.** Target claim, grounding holon, claim scope, polarity, relevance window, assurance use, weight model, and provenance constraints are hidden behind one source label ending in *Role*.
4. **Evidence and status collapse.** A status badge, standard reference, approval-looking display, publication face, or requirement source is treated as evidence, status assertion, gate passage, permission, and assurance at once.
5. **Work confusion.** The work that produced an episteme and the later use of that episteme as evidence are folded into one relation.
6. **Causal-use laundering.** Observational association, intervention, realized counterfactual sample, identified counterfactual estimate, and simulation-only output are relabelled by evidence-wording instead of being governed by `C.28`.
7. **Cross-local leakage.** Evidence accepted under one source scheme, ClaimScope, and use is reused under another without recovering the changed meaning, source currentness, reliance, or assurance-use conditions and any actual F.9 relation.

### A.2.4:3 - Forces

| Force | Tension this pattern resolves |
| --- | --- |
| Episteme identity versus episteme use | The same episteme can be used for several claims while retaining its identity. |
| Compact evidence statement versus full evidence graph | Users need a small evidence-use statement first; `A.10` remains the pattern for full evidence-provenance graph detail. |
| Formal proof versus empirical evidence | A proof can be stable inside one theory version; empirical evidence usually needs relevance windows, freshness, and provenance constraints. |
| Status display versus status assertion | A visible badge, cell, or label can cue status but does not by itself create permission, gate passage, assurance, or work evidence. |
| Local acceptance versus cross-local reuse | Evidence and status use are bounded by their source scheme, ClaimScope, window, and intended use; reuse recovers the changed values and any required F.9, source-currentness, publication-use, reliance, or assurance-use relation. |
| Causal evidence classes versus ordinary evidence relation | Causal-use evidence classes need `C.28`; A.2.4 keeps the evidence-use relation from being misread as a system-role kind or assignment. |

### A.2.4:4 - Solution

Do not create or use source spelling `U.EvidenceRole` as a durable FPF kind. Do not place an episteme in `U.SystemRoleAssignment` merely because it is used as evidence, source, standard, requirement, definition, explanation, publication, status bearer, or assurance input.

Use direct relation patterns instead:

| Current claim | Use |
| --- | --- |
| one episteme is used as evidence for one claim, effect, or bounded reliance use | `A.10`, with the A.2.4 evidence-use SlotKinds below |
| evidence is used by an actual named assurance claim | `B.3`, after A.10 source/provenance recovery and bounded-reliance classification; A.2.4 supplies only the first-use classification |
| the episteme itself is being identified, versioned, or distinguished from publication faces and publication carriers | `C.2.1` |
| the use is causal, counterfactual, intervention-facing, or simulation-only | `C.28`, with the A.10 descriptive source/provenance path and the A.2.4 first-use classification as inputs |
| the source says "status", "approved", "current", "valid", "stale", "ready", or another status-like value | `F.10` or the direct status, gate, permission, safety, or release pattern; A.10 for bounded reliance and B.3 for an actual named assurance claim |
| the source is a publication face, view, description, source citation, standard, requirement, explanation, or specification-use case | `E.17`, `E.17.0`, `E.17.2`, `E.17.EFP`, `E.10.D2`, or the direct source-use pattern |
| an admitted system is classified under an exact local system-role kind, holds an obtaining assignment, and performs or prepares Work | `A.2`, `A.2.1`, `A.15`, `A.15.1`, or `A.15.2` |

#### A.2.4:4.0 - First-use split

An A.2.4 assertion answers only: which episteme is classified for which evidence-use or status-use, under which effective source scheme when interpretation matters, with which ClaimScope, polarity or status value, and window. When source production, evaluation, a local result, result episteme, provenance, currentness, receiving work, reliance, or assurance matters, the assertion names the direct object and the pattern passage that defines or constrains its claim; it does not re-express them as slots of a generic evidence result.

#### A.2.4:4.1 - Evidence-Use Relation Slots

An evidence-use relation obtains around an episteme and a claim or effect.

| SlotKind | ValueKind | Identity and currentness discipline |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `EvidenceEpistemeSlot` | exact `U.Episteme` classified for evidence use | Identity of the classified episteme. |
| `EvidenceTargetClaimSlot` | claim or theory statement | Identity slot whenever the relation is claim-bound; a missing value blocks claim-bound evidence use. |
| `EvidenceClaimGroundingHolonSlot` | exact `U.Holon` that participates in an obtaining C.2.1 `EpistemeEmpiricalGroundingRelation` covering the target claim | Identity or currentness-required when changing the grounding holon changes the evidence relation or the claim being evidenced. |
| `EvidenceClaimScopeSlot` | claim-scope value governed by `B.3`, `A.10`, `C.28`, or a direct evidence pattern | Identity qualifier when changing scope changes the relation; currentness-required when scope changes admissible use. |
| `EvidencePolaritySlot` | evidential polarity value such as supports, refutes, constrains, or neutral when that value set is current | Identity qualifier when changing polarity changes which evidence-use relation is asserted. |
| `EvidenceRelevanceWindowSlot` | temporal relevance window, theory-version fence, freshness policy, or decay policy | Identity or currentness-required when time, version, or freshness changes the evidence use; consideration slot for formal uses where the theory-version fence already carries the boundary. |
| `EvidenceAssuranceUseSlot` | the named bounded reliance or assurance-facing use | Records the intended receiving use only; A.10 is the pattern for the local disposition and B.3 is the pattern for any assurance result. |
| `EvidenceWeightModelSlot` | weight, confidence, reliability, likelihood, or scoring model reference | Consideration slot; currentness-required when weighted evidence is claimed. |
| `EvidenceProvenanceConstraintSlot` | refs to the exact A.10/G.6 source and provenance account | Currentness-required when provenance or a rival explanation decides admissible use. |

These SlotKinds are evidence-use relation positions.

#### A.2.4:4.2 - Status-Use Relation Slots

A status-use relation is a relation around a bearer, status value, scope, window, source, and use.

| SlotKind | ValueKind | Use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `StatusBearerSlot` | episteme, claim, method description, publication, system-role-assignment occurrence, work occurrence, clause, gate record, or another governed bearer admitted by the direct pattern | The value whose status is being asserted or read. |
| `StatusTargetSlot` | claim, method, episteme, publication, exact domain result or result episteme, clause, bearer, or another governed status target | Required when the status is not simply about the bearer itself; the direct status or result pattern defines it. |
| `StatusScopeSlot` | claim scope, admission scope, requirement scope, or use scope | Currentness-required when scope changes the status assertion. |
| `StatusValueSlot` | status value governed by `F.10` or a direct pattern | Required for a status assertion. |
| `StatusWindowSlot` | temporal validity window, freshness policy, or source/status window | Required for time-sensitive use; G.11 is the pattern for an edition-currentness result when currentness is being judged. |
| `StatusUseSlot` | gate, assurance, admission, source-currentness, work-plan readiness, or another exact receiving use | Identifies the intended use; its receiving work, direct relation, and result remain with their governors. |
| `StatusProvenanceConstraintSlot` | source order, authority source, publication, proof, verification, register, or provenance constraint | Currentness-required when provenance decides status use. |

These names are repair vocabulary for status-use relations. Durable status families remain governed by `F.10` or a direct status pattern.

#### A.2.4:4.3 - Minimal Evidence-Use Statement

Write only fields that decide this first use:

```text

  UnsupportedOverread:                # only when grounded and consequential under F.19:4
```

A.2.4 does not fill a missing direct governor with a generic status, evidence, work-result, or evaluation-result relation.

#### A.2.4:4.5 - Formal, empirical, causal, and status first uses

Source labels such as `AxiomaticProofRole`, `ObservationEvidenceRole`, `MeasurementEvidenceRole`, `ModelFitEvidenceRole`, `CalibrationEvidenceRole`, and `BenchmarkEvidenceRole` are wording triggers. Recover the exact first-use classification or relation; the labels are neither local system-role kinds nor result kinds by spelling.

**Formal line.** Classify the exact proof, derivation, counterexample, theory note, or proof-result episteme against the named theorem and theory-version fence. The formal pattern contains the defining content for entailment, refutation, malformed-proof, timeout, or checker-failure results; C.2.1 is the pattern for the episteme that states the result. When proof-checking is asserted as dated `U.Work`, use A.13 to identify the actual performer and A.15.1 to admit the occurrence independently. If the proof-checking account must also identify the assignment under which the Work was performed, check that relation separately through F.6. Keep the Method and bindings separate. A.2.4 states only how the episteme is used.

**Empirical and measurement line.** Classify the exact dataset, observation episteme, C.16 measurement-result episteme, replication result, calibration result, benchmark result, or model-fit result episteme against one named claim. For any producing or evaluating Work, use A.13 to identify the actual performer and A.15.1 to admit the dated occurrence independently. If that account must also identify the assignment under which the Work was performed, check it separately through F.6. Keep direct relations or A.6.1 bindings separate. Each local result remains with C.16 or its exact domain governor; A.10/G.6 retain provenance; G.11 retains currentness.

**Causal line.** C.28 is the pattern for the causal-use question, estimand, separate evidence/identification/estimate/sampling/simulation components, realizability, support result, supported use, and unsupported use. A.2.4 may classify the exact C.2.1 episteme used at first contact; evidence wording cannot turn simulator output into interventional or realized-counterfactual evidence.

**Status line.** A visible status carrier is classified separately from the governed status assertion. F.10 or the exact status pattern contains the defining content for the status value, G.11 is the pattern for edition currentness, and a gate, permission, commitment, system-role-kind, assignment, Work, assurance, or decision pattern contains the defining content for its own result. Display presence establishes none of them.

#### A.2.4:4.6 - Work, result, provenance, and receiving-use boundary

Keep these objects separately recoverable whenever they are current:

1. the classified episteme and the exact claim or status for which it is used;
2. each actual performer identified through A.13; the dated source-producing or evaluating Work independently admitted through A.15.1; a separate F.6 check when the result must also identify the assignment under which that Work was performed; and separate Method, resources, and actual direct/A.6.1 bindings;
3. the domain-local result and its direct governor;
4. the distinct C.2.1 episteme that states that result;
5. the A.10/G.6 source and provenance path;
6. the G.11 currentness result when currentness affects use;
7. the receiving dated work and exact premise, reference, decision-use, operation-argument, or other direct use relation; and
8. the local A.10 `RelianceDisposition`.

Use B.3 only when an actual named assurance claim is being made. If a direct domain rule requires one for the intended use, state that claim and its required basis first.

Use A.2.4 only to classify evidence use or status use around the episteme.

When episteme inception through work matters, A.15.PROD supplies the local entity-identity inception claim.

#### A.2.4:4.7 - Shortcut cost and reopen condition

A.2.4 is the inexpensive first-use classifier. It may identify the episteme, target claim or status, effective source scheme when material, ClaimScope, polarity or value, window, intended use, applicable definition or constraint, and any unsupported overread grounded under F.19:4. It does not decide the source work, local result, provenance, currentness, assurance, causal support, gate passage, permission, commitment, publication interpretation, or receiving action.

Open only the exact subject question whose predicate decides the use: A.13 for the actual performer; A.15.1 for independent Work admission; F.6 when the result must also identify the assignment under which that Work was performed; A.6.1 for actual bindings; the domain result predicate plus C.2.1 for result content; A.10/G.6 for provenance and bounded reliance; G.11 for currentness; B.3 for assurance; C.28 for causal use; F.10 for a status family; or E.17 for publication. Reopen the A.2.4 classification when the episteme, target claim/status, scope, polarity/value, window, or intended use changes.

### A.2.4:5 - Archetypal Grounding

#### A.2.4:5.1 - Proof result used as evidence

`ProofResult-12` is a C.2.1 episteme stating an entailment under `GraphTheory_v3.1`. Dated checker work, its method, theory and proof bindings, and the formal entailment result are recovered under their subject patterns. A.2.4 classifies the episteme as supporting `Theorem-12` inside the theory-version fence. A.10 records source/provenance; in later review work, a reviewer uses the episteme through an exact premise relation. Timeout or checker failure would remain distinct from refutation.

#### A.2.4:5.2 - Measurement result used in acceptance

`PressureResult-E` is the C.16 measurement-result episteme for gas pressure at port P. It states the measurand, Characteristic, Scale, value, uncertainty, model, calibration basis, time stance, and dated measurement work. A.2.4 classifies it as evidence used for the exact pressure-limit claim. In separate evaluation work, an evaluator applies the G.4 clause through A.6.1 bindings and obtains `unknown`; a different C.2.1 episteme states that verdict. A.10/G.6 preserve provenance, G.11 currentness, and in later C.11 decision work, a decision-maker relies on the verdict episteme. Raw detector output, indication, pressure state, measurement result, verdict, and decision remain distinct.

#### A.2.4:5.3 - Dashboard status cell

A release dashboard displays `Ready`. A.2.4 may classify the cell as a status-use carrier for one named status assertion. The source register, scope, window, status value, G.11 currentness, and provenance must be recoverable. A.21 remains the pattern for any gate decision, C.11 any release decision, A.2.8.PER any permission, A.15.1 any performed work, and B.3 any assurance claim. A copied or stale cell establishes none of them.

#### A.2.4:5.4 - Simulation-only output

A simulation-output episteme is classified for one bounded C.28 claim. C.28 retains `simulationResultRef`, model assumptions, validation, the causal-use support result, supported use, and unsupported use. A.2.4 cannot relabel the episteme as realized-counterfactual or interventional evidence; simulation Work, simulator result, result episteme, provenance, and later reliance remain separate.

### A.2.4:6 - Bias-Annotation

This pattern mainly blocks six biases:

* **episteme-as-system-role-holder bias**: an episteme is placed in `U.SystemRoleAssignment` because it is useful as evidence or status;
* **evidence-name-as-kind bias**: an evidence-use label ending in *Role* is treated as a local system-role kind without a C.3 identity basis and membership criterion;
* **status-display-as-authority bias**: a visible badge or status cell becomes gate passage, permission, or assurance;
* **work-as-evidence-use collapse**: producing work, produced episteme, and later evidence use are treated as one relation;
* **scope-free evidence bias**: target claim, grounding holon, claim scope, polarity, time, assurance use, or provenance constraints are omitted;
* **causal laundering bias**: causal evidence classes are changed by source vocabulary rather than by `C.28` causal-use reasoning.

The repair is to recover the episteme first, then recover the evidence-use, status-use, source-use, publication-use, assurance-use, or causal-use relation that is current.

### A.2.4:7 - Conformance Checklist

| Check | Pass condition |
| --- | --- |
| `CC-A2.4-1` First-use object | One exact episteme and one target claim or governed status assertion are named. |
| `CC-A2.4-2` Admitted job | The statement is only an evidence-use or status-use classification; no `U.EvidenceRole`, episteme-as-system-role-kind classification, assignment holder, or generic result kind is created. |
| `CC-A2.4-3` Scope and interpretation | Effective source scheme when material, grounding holon, claim or status scope, polarity or value, and relevance or status window are explicit when they change the use. |
| `CC-A2.4-4` Work | For any source-producing, measurement, proof-checking, evaluation, transformation, or receiving Work, A.13 identifies the actual performer and A.15.1 independently admits the dated occurrence. Add F.6 only when the result must also identify the assignment under which that Work was performed. The Method and direct-relation or A.6.1 bindings remain separate. |
| `CC-A2.4-5` Local result | The domain-local result points to its exact formal, measurement, causal, diagnostic, conformance, comparison, selection, acceptance, gate, permission, commitment, system-role-kind, assignment, or decision governor. |
| `CC-A2.4-6` Result episteme | The C.2.1 episteme that states the local result remains distinct from that result, carrier, and work. |
| `CC-A2.4-7` Provenance/currentness | Use A.10 and G.6 for source recovery and provenance; use G.11 for currentness when it affects use. |
| `CC-A2.4-8` Receiving use | When a particular receiving Work or receiving-use relation is asserted, name that Work and relation. Citation or availability alone does not establish actual use. |
| `CC-A2.4-9` Reliance/assurance | A.10 defines the bounded `RelianceDisposition`. Use B.3 only when an actual named assurance claim is being made. If a direct domain rule requires one for the intended use, state that claim and its required basis first. |
| `CC-A2.4-10` Publication/display | Publication face, generated explanation, credential view, evidence profile, ledger edge, or dashboard cell does not establish status, result, work, gate, permission, or decision by presence. |
| `CC-A2.4-11` Causal boundary | C.28 is the pattern for causal-support components and results; source wording cannot promote simulation or observational evidence. |
| `CC-A2.4-12` Unsupported overread | State the stronger claim not carried by this first-use classification and its reopen condition only when that warning passes F.19:4's full independent-ground, plausible-reader, contribution, and smallest-clear-correction test. |

### A.2.4:8 - Common Anti-Patterns and How to Avoid Them

| Source wording | Failure | Repair |
| --- | --- | --- |
| "The report has EvidenceRole for Claim A." | Treats a source label as a system-role kind or assignment without recovering the actual relation. | Use an evidence-use relation with `EvidenceEpistemeSlot`, `EvidenceTargetClaimSlot`, scope, polarity, window, and provenance constraints when current. |
| "Dataset X proves safety." | Treats dataset presence as proof, assurance, and safety claim. | Use `A.10` for evidence, `B.3` for assurance or safety assurance, and name unsupported attempted use. |
| "The standard has normative role." | Role word hides standard-use, requirement-use, source-use, or publication-use. | Recover the relation governed by the current claim and apply `E.10.D2`, `E.17`, `F.10`, or the direct requirement pattern. |
| "The badge is current, so release is allowed." | Status display becomes gate passage or permission. | Use status-use relation plus gate or release subject pattern; dashboard display alone is not a decision. |
| "Simulation output is counterfactual evidence." | Simulator output is promoted to realized or interventional causal evidence. | Use `C.28`; keep `simulationResultRef`, model assumptions, validation, and bounded supported/unsupported use distinct from empirical, identification, estimate, and direct-sampling results. |
| "The work run is the evidence role." | Work occurrence, actual performer, assignment check, local result, result episteme, and later evidence-use are collapsed. | Use A.13 for the actual performer and A.15.1 for independent admission of the dated Work. Add F.6 only if the use must also identify the assignment under which the Work was performed. Use A.6.1 for actual bindings, the domain pattern for the local result, C.2.1 for its episteme, A.10/G.6 for provenance, and A.2.4 only for first-use classification. |

### A.2.4:9 - Consequences

The positive consequence is a smaller ontology and clearer use. Admitted systems may be classified under exact local system-role kinds and may hold obtaining system-role assignments; epistemes are instead used through direct evidence-use, status-use, source-use, publication-use, requirement-use, definition-use, explanation-use, assurance-use, or causal-use relations.

The cost is explicit relation recovery. A phrase such as "evidence role", "status role", "standard role", "proof role", or "benchmark role" no longer closes the claim. The user needs to recover which episteme, claim, scope, status, time window, provenance constraint, and direct pattern are current.

The payoff is that one episteme can be reused honestly across many claims. Each use can have a different target claim, grounding holon, scope, polarity, relevance window, assurance use, weight model, or provenance constraint without multiplying system-role kinds.

### A.2.4:10 - Rationale

An episteme may be used for several claims or governed statuses. State each evidence-use or status-use relation separately. The classification points outward to, and never replaces, performed Work, the domain-local result, the C.2.1 result episteme, provenance, currentness, receiving reliance, or assurance.

* **Builds on:** `A.2` for exact local system-role kinds, `A.2.1` for `U.SystemRoleAssignment`, `A.6.5` for SlotSpec discipline, and `C.2.1` for episteme identity and its distinct constitution, empirical-grounding, and edition relations.
* **Coordinates with:** `A.10` and `G.6` for descriptive source/provenance paths; `G.11` for currentness; `B.3` for assurance; `C.28` for causal-use results; `F.10` for status families; `C.2.1` for result epistemes; exact domain patterns for local results; and `E.17`/`E.10.D2` for publication, view, explanation, and description-use cases.
* **Separates from:** A.13 for actual performers; A.15.1 for independently admitted performed Work; F.6 when a receiving result must also identify the assignment under which that Work was performed; A.6.1 for actual bindings; A.15.PROD for episteme inception when current; gate, permission, commitment, system-role-kind, assignment, measurement, formal, diagnostic, conformance, comparison, selection, acceptance, causal, and decision patterns for their local results; and receiving-work patterns for actual later use.
* **Precision-restoration route:** When source wording says "evidence role", "status role", "standard role", or another role-shaped phrase around an episteme, use `E.10.ROLE` to recover the governed object or relation. Use `A.6.RSIR` only when the result is a relation participant meaning, declaration place, interface place, or representation position; use `E.10.ARCH` for the wider ontology-first repair architecture.

### A.2.4:12 - Lowering, Repair, and Refresh

Lower an attempted A.2.4 use when the episteme is known but the target claim, scope, polarity, status value, time window, or provenance constraints are not recoverable. The lowered result may be source-finding, orientation, an evidence-needed note, a status-source request, or a narrowed reliance use.

Repair the use when a neighboring object is current: dated work and actual bindings, a domain-local result, its C.2.1 episteme, source/provenance, G.11 currentness, receiving work and direct use, A.10 reliance, B.3 assurance, gate passage, permission, commitment, publication, requirement, definition, or explanation.

Refresh the use when the episteme edition, target claim, grounding holon, claim scope, theory version, relevance window, source-currentness relation, status source, proof check, measurement trace, method description, or assurance-use relation changes.
