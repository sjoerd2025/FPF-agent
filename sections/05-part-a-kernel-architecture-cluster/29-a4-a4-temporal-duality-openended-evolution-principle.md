## A.4 - Temporal Duality & Open‑Ended Evolution Principle

*“A holon is born in design‑time, lives in run‑time,
and is reborn when the world talks back.”*

### A.4:1 - Problem frame
A holon’s **actual condition** does not keep matching its **blueprint** for
long.  Pumps wear out, theories meet anomalous data, workflows face
unanticipated load.  FPF therefore requires a temporal framework that:

1. Physically grounds every modification (via the Transformer Principle,
   A.3).
2. Supports unbounded improvement cycles (**P‑10 Open‑Ended Evolution**).
3. Works identically for physical, epistemic, operational (method, work) and future
   holon flavours.

### A.4:2 - Problem

| Failure mode | Consequence |
|--------------|-------------|
| **Blueprint ≡ Reality** | “As‑built” discrepancies remain invisible; safety and validity claims become fiction. |
| **Implicit magic updates** | Versions overwrite each other; provenance chains snap. |
| **Observer special‑case** | Measurement treated as metaphysical rather than a normal, physically grounded transformation. |

### A.4:3 - Forces

| Force | Tension |
|-------|---------|
| **Stability vs Change** | Identify a holon across time ↔ allow radical redesigns. |
| **Prediction vs Evidence** | Plan with intended specs ↔ respond to real telemetry. |
| **Parsimony vs Expressiveness** | Keep the model lean ↔ respect the full state and evolution complexity. |

### A.4:4 - Solution - Temporal Duality Model

FPF assigns every holon state to one—and only one—of two **temporal
scopes**:

| Scope | Symbol | Definition | Typical contents |
|-------|--------|------------|------------------|
| **Design‑Time** | *Tᴰ* | Interval(s) during which the holon **may be structurally altered** by an *external* `Transformer` executing a `U.TransformationalMethod`. | Specs, CAD, theorem scripts, IaC SCRs. |
| **Run‑Time** | *Tᴿ* | Interval(s) during which the holon **executes its own `OperationalMethod`s** and is assumed structurally stable (self‑maintenance allowed). | Telemetry, transaction logs, field data, physical wear. |

**Temporal invariants**

```text
Tᴰ ∩ Tᴿ = ∅                     (never overlap)
Tᴰ ∪ Tᴿ = worldline(holon)      (cover full existence)
version(n+1) created only in Tᴰₙ (monotonic lineage)
````

#### A.4:4.1 - Open‑Ended Evolution Principle

A holon may repeat the cycle *ad infinitum*:

```
(H₀ in Tᴿ₀) → observe → Δspec in Tᴰ₁ → build → H₁ in Tᴿ₁ → …
```

*Observation itself is a transformation*:
the observer is the acting `U.System`. In the source notation, `holderRef` names
that System and `roleRef=TransformerRole@ObservationContext` names the assigned local
system-role kind. Identify the actual assignment through its directly declared
`U.SystemRoleAssignment` species (A.2.1). The System executes a
**measurement method** whose *output* is an epistemic holon containing observations.
Thus the traditional “External Observer Pattern” collapses into the universal external
Transformer pattern.

### A.4:5 - Archetypal Grounding

| Phase                 | Pump‑v2 (`U.System`)                                                                         | Proof‑v2 (`U.Episteme`)                                                                 |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Design‑Time**       | 3‑D CAD + G‑code; stress‑sim config.                                                         | Lean/Coq script of theorem; dependency graph.                                           |
| **Run‑Time**          | Pump circulates coolant under `OperatePump` method.                                          | Theorem cited & reused; runtime is “being relied on”.                                   |
| **Run → Design loop** | Sensor data shows cavitation; anomaly report produced by the monitoring server under `roleRef=TransformerRole@MonitoringContext`. | New experiment contradicts corollary; lab apparatus and scientists hold assignments to the locally defined `TransformerRole@ExperimentContext` kind. |
| **Design → Run loop** | Engineers author Pump‑v3 spec; the printer holds an assignment to the locally defined `TransformerRole@FabricationContext` kind while fabricating Pump‑v3.                    | Community revises proof; the proof assistant holds an assignment to the locally defined `TransformerRole@VerificationContext` kind while verifying Proof‑v3.         |


### A.4:6 - Conformance Checklist

| ID | Requirement | Purpose |
|----|-------------|---------|
| **CC‑A.4.1** | Every `U.Holon` **MUST** be tagged with its current temporal scope (*Tᴰ* or *Tᴿ*). | Makes temporal scope explicit. |
| **CC‑A.4.2** | A transition from *Tᴰ* → *Tᴿ* **SHALL** be modeled as `executes(Transformer, U.TransformationalMethod)`. | Links the transition to an instantiation claim. |
| **CC‑A.4.3** | A transition from *Tᴿ* → *Tᴰ* **SHALL** be modeled as `executes(Transformer, U.TransformationalMethod)` producing an observational `U.Episteme`. | Names the observational-episteme claim. |
| **CC‑A.4.4** | `Tᴰ ∩ Tᴿ = ∅` and the concatenated intervals **MUST** equal the holon’s worldline. | Guards against illicit overlap. |
| **CC‑A.4.5** | Each new design version **MUST** reference (`refinesVersion`) exactly one predecessor or declare `firstVersion = true`. | Records predecessor or first-version status. |

### A.4:7 - Consequences

| Benefits | Trade‑offs / Mitigations |
|----------|--------------------------|
| **Temporal and provenance inputs for review** – Temporal scope tags and predecessor references make timing and lineage claims available for review. | Additional metadata tagging. |
| **Unified View of Build & Measure** – Observation, test, simulation, maintenance, and fabrication all share one mechanism. | Requires modelers to think in terms of Transformers even for “passive” sensing; mitigated by role libraries (`transformerRole`, `CalibratorRole`, etc.). |
| **Foundation for Learning Loops** – Enables higher patterns (e.g., B.4 Canonical Evolution Loop, B.3 Trust and Assurance Calculus) to reason over evidence accrual and version fitness, including self-modification. | Requires maintaining the temporal and provenance metadata. |

### A.4:8 - Rationale (extended)

1. **Why separate scopes?**
   Real-world systems expose the *as-intended* versus *as-is* gap.
   By formalising that gap, FPF prevents silent assumption of perfect
   fidelity and allows quantified error (`U.Error`) to drive evolution.

2. **Why treat observation as transformation?**
   Use A.3 for the observing System and Method, A.15.1 for a dated
   measurement Work claim, and A.3.4 for any separately claimed actual change.

3. **Why insist on open‑endedness?**
   P‑10 expects entities to evolve indefinitely and requires cycles that remain
   cheap, safe, and cognitively rewarding. This pattern makes further revision
   explicit through repeated design/run cycles.

4. **Why no overlap (*Tᴰ* ∩ *Tᴿ*)?**
   The instant a holon is mutable (design) it ceases to be the “same”
   operational asset relied upon for guarantees.  Overlap would break
   trust calculations and violate A.7 Strict Distinction.

This pattern therefore realises three core principles in concert:

* **Temporal Duality** – explicit tagging of states.
* **Open‑Ended Evolution** – support for further refinement.
* **Ontological Parsimony** – one mechanism (Transformer) for all
  state changes, avoiding specialised “observer” or “installer” types.

> *“Blueprints dream; instances speak.
> Evolution is the conversation between them.”*
