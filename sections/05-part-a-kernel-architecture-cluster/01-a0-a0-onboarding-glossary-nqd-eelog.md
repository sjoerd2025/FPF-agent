## A.0 - Onboarding Glossary (NQD & E/E‑LOG)
**One‑screen purpose (manager‑first).** This pattern gives newcomers a plain‑language starter kit for FPF’s *generative* engine so they can run an admissible **problem-solving or search loop** on day one. It explains the few terms you must publish when you **generate, select, and ship declared set results or typed portfolio publications** (not single “winners”), and points to the formal anchors you’ll use later. *(OEE is a Pillar; NQD/E/E‑LOG are the engine parts.)*

**Builds on.** E.2 (**P‑10 Open‑Ended Evolution; P‑2 Didactic Primacy**), A.5, C.17–C.19 - **Coordinates with.** E.7, E.8, E.10; F.17 (UTS); G.5, G.9–G.12 - **Constrains.** Any pattern/UTS row that **describes a generator, selector, typed portfolio publication, or set-return publication surface**.

**Keywords & queries.** *novelty, quality‑diversity (NQD), explore/exploit (E/E‑LOG), **declared set result**, **typed portfolio publication**, illumination map *(report‑only telemetry)*, parity run, comparability, ReferencePlane, CL^plane, **ParetoOnly** default*

### A.0:1 - Problem Frame

Engineer‑managers meeting FPF for the first time need a **plain, on‑ramp vocabulary** for the framework’s *generative* engine so they can run an informed **problem‑solving/search loop** on day one—*before* formal specifications. Without that, Part G and Part F read as assurance/alignment only, and teams default to single “best” options. This **undercuts P‑10 Open‑Ended Evolution** and harms adoption.

### A.0:2 - Problem

In current practice:

* **Single‑winner bias.** Teams look for “the best” option and publish a leaderboard, suppressing **coverage & diversity** signals essential to search.
* **Metric confusion.** “Novelty” and “quality” are used informally; units and scales are omitted; ordinal values are averaged, breaking comparability.
* **Hidden policies.** Explore/exploit budgets and governor rules are implicit; results are irreproducible and **refresh‑unsafe** (no edition/policy pins).
* **Tool lock‑in.** Implementation terms (pipelines, file formats) leak into the Core, violating Guard‑Rails.

FPF needs a **short, normative glossary** that names the generative primitives in **Plain** register and ties each to its **formal anchor**—so declared set results and typed portfolio publications, not single scores, become the default publication.

### A.0:3 - Forces

| Force                         | Tension                                                                         |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Readability vs Rigor**      | One‑liners for managers ↔ lawful definitions with editions and scale types.     |
| **Creativity vs Assurance**   | Open‑ended search (OEE/QD) ↔ conformance, parity, and publication discipline.   |
| **Comparability vs Locality** | Shared N‑U‑C‑D terms ↔ context‑local CG‑frames and bridges with CL.             |
| **Tool‑agnostic Core**        | Conceptual publication in UTS ↔ engineering teams’ urge to cite specific tools. |

### A.0:4 - Solution - Normative onboarding glossary and publication hooks

#### 4.1 Plain one‑liners (normative on‑ramp; formal anchors in C.17–C.19)

| Term                      | Plain definition (on‑ramp)                                                                                                                                   | See        |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------- |
| **Novelty (N)**           | How unlike the known set a candidate is in your declared **CharacteristicSpace**. **Compute admissibly** (declared `DescriptorMapRef` + `DistanceDefRef`; no ad-hoc normalisation). | C.17, C.18 |
| **Use‑Value (U / ValueGain)** | What the candidate helps you achieve now under your **CG‑Frame**; tie to acceptance/tests; **publish units, scale kind, polarity, ReferencePlane**.                   | C.17, C.18 |
| **Constraint‑Fit (C)**    | *Satisfies must‑constraints (Resource/Risk/Ethics)*; legality via **CG‑Spec**; **unknowns propagate** (never coerce to zero).                                | C.18, G.4  |
| **Diversity_P (declared retained set)** | Coverage or dispersion of the declared retained set under a named measurement policy; declare **ReferencePlane**. Its change on adding one candidate is **DeltaDiversity_P**. | C.17, C.18 |
| **E/E‑LOG**               | *Named, versioned **explore↔exploit** policy*; governs when to widen space vs refine candidates; **policy‑id is published**.                                   | C.19       |
| **ReferencePlane**        | *Where a value lives:* **world** (system), **concept** (definition), **episteme** (about a claim). **Plane‑crossings add CL^plane** (penalties to **R only**); cite policy‑id. | F.9, G.6   |
| **Scale Variables (S)**  | *The **monotone knobs** along which improvement is expected* (e.g., parameterisation breadth, data exposure, iteration budget, resolution). **Declare S** for any generator/selector claimed to scale. | C.18.1       |
| **Scale Elasticity (χ)** | *Qualitative class of improvement when moving along S* (e.g., **rising**, **knee**, **flat** in the declared window). Used as a **selection lens**; numeric laws live in domain contexts.              | C.18.1       |
| **BLP (Bitter‑Lesson Preference)** | A preference supported by a comparable, uncertainty-qualified scale comparison; begin with a **cheap scale-claim probe**. **No scale claim yet** or **no scale-based preference** are valid results. A local generality policy is a separate declared basis. | C.19.1, C.24 |
| **Iso‑Scale Parity**  | *Fair comparison across candidates at equalised **scale budgets** along S*; may also include **scale‑probes** (two points) to test elasticity.                                                         | G.9, C.18.1  |

*(Registers & forbidden forms per **LEX‑BUNDLE**; avoid “axis/dimension/validity/process” for measurement and scope.)*

#### 4.2 Publication & telemetry duties (where these terms **show up**)

1. **UTS surface (Part F).** When a **UTS row describes a generator, selector, typed portfolio publication, or set-return publication surface**, it **MUST** surface **N, U, C, Diversity_P, E/E‑LOG `policy‑id`, `ReferencePlane`**, with **units, scale, and polarity** typed under **MM‑CHR** and **CG‑Spec**, and admissible references to `DescriptorMapRef` and `DistanceDefRef`. *(Row schema: F.17; shipping via G.10.)*
2. **Parity & edition pins (Part G).** When QD/OEE is in scope, **pin** `DescriptorMapRef.edition` and `DistanceDefRef.edition` (and, where applicable, `CharacteristicSpaceRef.edition`, `TransferRulesRef.edition`) and record `policy‑id` + `PathSliceId`. Treat **illumination/coverage as report‑only telemetry**; publish an **Illumination Map** where G‑kit mandates parity records. **Declare S** (Scale Variables) and run at least one **scale‑probe** (two points along S) when claiming **scale‑amenability**. **Dominance policy defaults to `ParetoOnly`;** including illumination in dominance **MUST** cite a CAL policy‑id.
3. **Tell‑Show‑Show (E.7/E.8).** Any architectural pattern that claims generative behaviour **MUST** embed **both** a **U.System** and a **U.Episteme** illustration using this glossary (manager‑first didactics).

#### 4.3 Minimal first-day construction
1) Declare **CG‑Frame** (what “quality” means; admissible units and scales) and **ReferencePlane**.
2) Pick 2–4 **Q components** + a simple **DescriptorMap** (≥2 dims) for N/D; publish **editions**.
3) Choose an **E/E‑LOG policy** (explore↔exploit budget); record **policy‑id**.
4) Apply **G.5** selection/dispatch with parity pins. Keep any consumed `Front` or `Archive` identified as the source set. For a set outcome, return `Shortlist` or `RankedShortlist` for retained alternatives, or `JointUseSet` when all named members are included for one named use. Return a handoff, abstain, or escalation when that is the actual G.5 outcome.
5) Keep the actual **G.5 outcome**'s required content and basis pins. **Publish that result only when the receiving use calls for publication**, with its applicable **PathIds/PathSliceId**. Add a **UTS row** for a named governed value only when **F.17**'s independent naming and reuse conditions hold; otherwise reuse its existing designation. Follow the outcome's continuation or stop. An **Illumination Map** remains **report‑only telemetry** by default.

### A.0:5 - Archetypal Grounding
*Informative; manager‑first (E.7/E.8 Tell‑Show‑Show).*

**Show‑A - SRE capacity plan (selector returns a set).**
*Frame.* We must raise service commitment headroom for Q4 without breaking latency SLOs.
*Declared retained set.* `{cache‑expansion, read‑replicas, query‑shaping, circuit‑breaker tuning, schema‑denorm}`.
*Glossary in action.* `U = latency@p95 & error‑rate`, `C = budget ≤ $X, risk ≤ R`, `N = dissimilarity to current playbook`, `Diversity_P = coverage of the declared retained set under the niche policy`, `DeltaDiversity_P = additional coverage from adding a candidate (e.g., “shifts load to edge” fills an empty niche)`. E/E‑LOG starts **Explore‑heavy**, flips **Exploit‑heavy** once ≥ K distinct niches are lit. *(Publish UTS row + parity pins; illumination stays report‑only telemetry.)*

**Show‑B - Policy search with QD archive (MAP‑Elites‑class).**
*Frame.* Robotics team explores gaits that trade stability vs energy use.
*Glossary in action.* `CharacteristicSpace = {step‑frequency, lateral‑stability}`, `ArchiveConfig = CVT grid`, `N` from descriptor distance, `U` = task reward, `Diversity_P` = coverage of the retained gait set under the declared grid policy; **PortfolioMode=Archive**. Families include **MAP‑Elites (2015)**, **CMA‑ME/MAE (2020–)**, **Differentiable QD/MEGA (2022–)**, **QDax (2024)**; publish editions and policy‑ids; treat illumination as **report‑only telemetry**.

*(Optional)* **Show‑C - OEE parity (POET/Enhanced‑POET).**
Co‑evolve declared `{environment, method}` sets; publish **coverage/regret** as telemetry metrics; pin `TransferRulesRef.edition`; return *sets*, not a single winner.

**Show‑Epi - Evidence synthesis (U.Episteme).**
*Frame.* A living review compares rival **causal identification** methods (e.g., IV vs. DiD vs. RCT‑adjacent surrogates) across policy domains.
*Glossary in action.* `U = external‑validity gain @ F/G‑declared lanes`, `C = ethics & data‑licence constraints`, `N = dissimilarity in **ClaimGraph** transformations`, `D_P = coverage of identification niches in the archive`. `ReferencePlane = episteme`. Illumination/coverage stays **report‑only telemetry**; selection returns a declared retained-set result or portfolio-publication view of methods per niche. *(Publish UTS rows; cite Bridges + CL for cross‑domain reuse; edition‑pin Descriptor/Distance defs where QD applies.)*

### A.0:6 - Bias-Annotation

**Scope.** Trans‑disciplinary; glossary applies to work concerning both **Systems** and **Epistemes**.
**Known risks & mitigations.**
*Over‑aggregation:* forbid mixed‑scale sums; use **CG‑frame** and **MM‑CHR**.
*Terminology drift:* enforce **LEX‑BUNDLE** registers; ban tool jargon in Core.
*Optimization monoculture:* require declared set-result or typed portfolio publication where G‑kit mandates parity; illumination stays **report‑only telemetry** unless a CAL policy promotes it (policy‑id cited).

### A.0:7 - Conformance Checklist (SCR/RSCR stubs)

| ID          | Requirement                                                                                                                                                                               | Purpose                                                                         |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **CC‑A0‑1** | If a pattern/UTS row **describes a generator, selector, typed portfolio publication, or set-return publication surface**, it **MUST** surface **N, U, C, Diversity_P, `ReferencePlane`, and E/E‑LOG `policy‑id`**; **units, scale, and polarity** **MUST** be declared. | Makes generative claims comparable and auditable (UTS as publication surface).  |
| **CC‑A0‑2** | When QD/OEE is in scope, **pin** editions: `DescriptorMapRef.edition`, `DistanceDefRef.edition` (and, where applicable, `CharacteristicSpaceRef.edition`, `TransferRulesRef.edition`); log `PathSliceId` and policy‑ids. | Enables admissible parity and refresh; edition-aware telemetry.                       |
| **CC‑A0‑3** | **No mixed‑scale roll‑ups**; ordinal data **SHALL NOT** be averaged; any roll‑up **MUST** live under a declared **CG‑frame**.                                                             | Prevents illegal scoring; keeps comparisons lawful.                             |
| **CC‑A0‑4** | Where the G‑kit requires parity, **publish an Illumination Map** (coverage per niche); **single‑number leaderboards are non‑conformant** on the Core surface when a ParityReport is required. | Declared-set-first / typed portfolio-publication posture; avoids single‑winner bias.                         |
| **CC‑A0‑5** | Keep **illumination/coverage** as **report‑only telemetry**; **dominance policy defaults to `ParetoOnly`**; any change is CAL‑authorised and cited by policy‑id.                                          | Separates fit from exploration; preserves auditability.                         |
| **CC‑A0‑6** | Apply **E.7/E.8**: include a **U.System** and a **U.Episteme** illustration when claiming generative behaviour; obey **E.10** register hygiene; use the exact subsection title **“Archetypal Grounding.”** | Locks didactic primacy; prevents jargon drift.                                  |
| **CC-A0-7** | **ReferencePlane declared** for every N/U/C/Diversity_P head and **CL^plane** penalties **route to R only**; **Φ_plane** policy-id published when planes differ.                            | Prevents plane/stance category errors; aligns with Bridge/**GateCrossing visibility** guards (Bridge+UTS+CL/Φ_plane). |
| **CC‑A0‑8** | **Diversity_P ≠ Illumination.** Diversity_P may enter dominance; **Illumination** remains **report‑only telemetry** unless explicitly promoted by CAL policy‑id.                                         | Matches QD triad semantics and parity defaults.                                 |
| **CC‑A0‑9** | For any generator/selector **scale-behaviour claim**, declare **S (Scale Variables)**, its **ScaleWindow**, and an **E/E-LOG scale policy-id**. Mark **S = N/A** only when no scale-behaviour claim is made. | Keeps a negative scale result within its declared comparison basis. |
| **CC‑A0‑10** | For scale-behaviour claims, execute a **scale-probe** (≥ 2 points along S within the declared ScaleWindow) and report a **Scale Elasticity class** (*rising/knee/flat/declining*) in the UTS row, under **C.18.1**. | Reports adverse response as declining rather than hiding it as flat or N/A. |
| **CC‑A0‑11** | Apply **Iso‑Scale Parity** in parity runs when S is declared; where infeasible, state the **loss notes** and treat results as **non‑parity** with an explicit penalty in **R**.             | Keeps comparisons fair and auditable under scale constraints.                    |
| **CC‑A0‑12** | Record a **BLP-waiver** only when overriding an actual declared generality preference that would otherwise decide the use. Apply **C.19.1**'s governed grounds: admissibility override, parity-supported scale-probe overturn, or non-blocking complementary bias. Bounded specialization alone requires no waiver. | Makes an actual policy override transparent without imposing one on ordinary bounded tactics. |

### A.0:8 - Consequences

**Benefits.**
- **Immediate usability** for engineer‑managers (plain one‑liners) with **formal anchors** for auditors.
- **Declared-set-first / typed portfolio-publication** culture (typed set results & illumination) instead of brittle leaderboards.
- **Edition‑aware comparability**; parity/refresh is routine, not ad‑hoc.

**Trade‑offs & mitigations.**
- Slightly longer UTS rows → mitigated by consistent schema and copy‑paste snippets.
- Requires discipline on units and scales → mitigated by CG‑frame templates.

### A.0:9 - Rationale

This pattern **instantiates P‑10 Open‑Ended Evolution** by making *generation‑selection‑publication* **operational** at the on‑ramp: readers get just enough shared vocabulary to run *search as standard practice*. It aligns with **Didactic Primacy (P‑2)** and **LEX‑BUNDLE (E.10)** by keeping definitions *plain‑first* and scale‑lawful, and with **Patterns Layering (P‑5)** by pointing to C.17–C.19 for formal anchors without tool lock‑in. The post‑2015 line (MAP‑Elites → CMA‑ME/MAE → Differentiable QD/MEGA → QDax; POET/Enhanced‑POET/Darwinian Goedel Machine) normalised **quality‑diversity** and **open‑endedness** as first‑class search objectives; this glossary surfaces those ideas as **publication standards**, not tool recipes.

### A.0:10 - Relations

**Builds on.** **E.2 Pillars** (P-10, P-2, P-6), **A.5** (Open-Ended Kernel), **B.5/B.5.2.1** (Abductive loops + NQD integration), **C.17–C.19** (Creativity-CHR, open-ended search archive/front stewardship, E/E-LOG).

**Coordinates with.** **E.7/E.8** (Archetypal Grounding; Authoring template), **E.10** (LEX‑BUNDLE), **F.17** (UTS), **G.5/G.9–G.12** (set‑returning selectors, **iso‑scale** parity, shipping & refresh).
**Constrains.** Any generator/selector/typed portfolio publication on the Core surface: **N‑U‑C‑Diversity_P + policy‑ids; S/Scale‑probe where applicable; parity pins; lawful scales; declared-set publication where mandated**. (Ties into UTS rows and parity records.)
For agentic orchestration of scalable tool‑calls under **BLP**/**SLL**, see **C.24 (Agent‑Tools‑CAL)**.

### A.0:QF.0a - Scope of this glossary

This pattern is an **on‑ramp**: it **does not replace** C.17–C.19. It binds Plain definitions to **publication/telemetry** expectations so newcomers can *use* NQD/E/E‑LOG immediately while experts follow the formal trails.

### A.0:QF.1 - Early set-result and metric-kind vocabulary

- Use `Palette` for a plurality-preserving set with no dominance semantics yet.
- Use `TraditionPalette` only when the members are traditions gathered before later comparison or choice semantics are declared.
- For methods, hypotheses, environment-method pairs, candidate explanations, or other member kinds, use `Palette` plus explicit `SubjectKind` instead of borrowing the `TraditionPalette` head.
- Use `Front` only for a non-dominated set under one declared `DominanceSet`.
- Use `Q-Front` when the declared `DominanceSet` is the declared `Q` components.
- Use `Archive` for a retained set whose purpose is coverage, stepping-stone retention, or frontier expansion rather than current non-domination.
- Use `ExplorationArchive` for the broad retained exploration surface; it is the exploration-specific specialization of `Archive`.
- Use `SteppingStoneSet` only for one narrower retained subset whose stated purpose is future frontier reach rather than the whole archive. It is not part of the ordinary first-pass public-head family for retained exploration.
- Use `Shortlist` for the set chosen from one declared source set by one named lens.
- Use `RankedShortlist` only when that shortlist is explicitly rank-ordered.
- Use `JointUseSet` when every exact member is included for one named use; keep that use, keyed member entries, inclusion conditions, and basis pins under `G.5`.
- Use `ShortlistId` for the stable public token of one emitted shortlist; it is not the shortlist itself.
- Use `ChoiceSet` only when the mathematical set object underlying one shortlist must be named explicitly; do not let it replace the public shortlist head.
- Use `Q-set` for the declared current objective tuple that may ground the current `DominanceSet`.
- For a result or claim used by a pool policy, retain its direct pattern's reference name and kind; for example, `A.2.2` supplies `capabilityInstanceRef` and `capabilityStatementRef`. Use `C.19` for the resulting pool treatment. Citing an input does not add it to `Q` or dominance.
- Use `competenceModelRef` under `C.19` only for one exact model episteme used by the policy; identify the capability and supporting results separately.
- When the pool treatment relies on an evidence-bearing or source-bearing claim, use `a10RelianceRef` for the exact claim and bounded pool-treatment reliance under `A.10`.
- Use `goalSpaceExpansionPolicyRef` under `C.19` when an independently declared archive or curriculum expansion policy governs goal- or task-space growth; that policy does not place a candidate on a front or add a dominance coordinate.
- When future reach depends on a transition or transfer relation, cite its direct rule and supporting result references together with any model episteme actually used. Keep their use in archive/pool policy separate from any explicitly authorized promotion into dominance.
- If one front is meant to be current-`Q` by default, say so as `Q-Front` or as `Front over the declared Q components` rather than leaving the relation between `Q-set` and `DominanceSet` implicit.
- `Use-Value` may be one member of the `Q-set` only when the current Context declares it there; it is not the whole `Q-set` or the default `Q-set` by itself.
- Metric-kind doctrine: the `Q-set` is the candidate/front-facing objective tuple; `Novelty@context` is one context-relative candidate signal; `DeltaDiversity_P` is one set-relative marginal diversity contribution; `IlluminationSummary` is one report-only archive telemetry summary unless one explicit policy promotes it.
- Minimal mathematical lens: the current front lives in one declared comparison or outcome space, while the exploration archive may depend on one declared search, niche, or reachability space. Keep both spaces explicit when they differ.
- Keep `Novelty@context`, `DeltaDiversity_P`, `Surprise`, and `IlluminationSummary` outside the default `Q-set` unless one declared `PromotionPolicy` says otherwise.
- A reader should be able to tell whether one sentence is talking about a `Palette`, a `Front`, an `Archive`, a `SteppingStoneSet`, a `Shortlist`, a `RankedShortlist`, or a `JointUseSet`, and whether one selected set came from one declared source set, before later policy or geometry detail arrives.
- Use `portfolio` only when the portfolio or set-result field is a declared retained set plus a selection/retention rule or a portfolio-publication posture. Do not use bare `portfolio` when `Palette`, `Front`, `Archive`, `SteppingStoneSet`, `Shortlist`, or `RankedShortlist` is already recoverable.

### A.0:QF.1a - Helper declarations for set-result language

- Ordinary public set-result family heads are `Palette`, `TraditionPalette`, `Front`, `Q-Front`, `Archive`, `ExplorationArchive`, `Shortlist`, `RankedShortlist`, and `JointUseSet`; the applicable pattern fixes which families its operation may return.
- `ExplorationArchive` is the exploration-specific specialization of `Archive`; use `Archive` as the wider family head only when that exploration-specific subtype does not matter.
- `SteppingStoneSet` is one narrow retained-subset head only when that subset itself is the visible published surface; do not treat it as the ordinary public head for retained exploration.
- `ShortlistId` is the stable public token or id companion for one emitted shortlist; it is not a set-result family head.
- `ChoiceSet` is only the mathematical set gloss for a shortlist when that object itself must be named.
- `SetResultFamily` is a declaration field naming which public set-result family is being emitted; it is not another public head.
- `SourceSetFamily` is a declaration field naming the immediate source-set family acted on by a lens, such as `Q-Front`, `ExplorationArchive`, `Front`, `Archive`, or `TraditionPalette`; it does not carry derivation, composition, or object-id load, and it does not rename the emitted result.
- `SourceSetComposition` is an optional declaration field naming a multi-source composition such as `Front+Archive` when one lens genuinely acts over more than one declared source-set family; it is not itself a kind.
- `SubjectKind` is a declaration field naming what the members are, such as traditions, methods, hypotheses, environment-method pairs, candidate explanations, or other subject-kinded alternatives.
- `EligibilitySet`, `DominanceSet`, `TieBreakerSet`, and `TelemetrySet` are the comparison-bundle sets behind the published set result, not rival publication heads: `EligibilitySet` says what may enter, `DominanceSet` says what counts for current non-domination, `TieBreakerSet` says what may order or choose among survivors, and `TelemetrySet` says what may be reported without changing dominance.
- `PromotionPolicy` is the policy pin that authorizes one tie-breaker or telemetry signal to move into dominance. Without that pin, novelty, diversity, surprise, illumination, or similar signals remain outside the current `DominanceSet`.
- `DerivedViewKind` is an optional declaration field for a derived view, such as one tradition view used for interpretation or publication. It must leave the base `SourceSetFamily`, `SetResultFamily`, and emitted shortlist family recoverable.
- `BasePaletteRef` is an optional cited id/ref for the base palette when one derived tradition view or shortlist depends on that palette; it is a ref, not a kind.
- Stable values for `SetResultFamily`, `SourceSetFamily`, `SourceSetComposition`, `SubjectKind`, and `DerivedViewKind` should come from controlled tokens, cited ids, or already-declared head labels; do not let one ad hoc local prose label become a de facto field value.
- When the upstream object is `SoTAPaletteDescription` and its members are traditions, `TraditionPalette` may be used as the reader-facing tradition-only palette head for that same palette declaration. It is an aliasing head over the same palette declaration, not a separate palette declaration. When the members are not traditions, keep `SoTAPaletteDescription` or `Palette + SubjectKind` explicit instead of widening `TraditionPalette`.
- `RetentionIntent=steppingStone` is a field value on retained archive membership when the purpose is future frontier reach; it is not the same publication move as publishing a `SteppingStoneSet`, which names a narrower retained subset only when that subset itself is the published set result being discussed and not the default archive head.

### A.0:QF.2 - First public wording for shortlisted results

- When one reader needs the visible selected set, say `Shortlist from <SourceSetFamily> under <LensId>` rather than one generic `choice set` or `portfolio`.
- When the selected set must be cited as one stable emitted object, say `ShortlistId` and keep one nearby line that names the shortlist and its source set.
- When the shortlist is ordered, say `RankedShortlist` and keep the underlying shortlisted set result recoverable rather than jumping straight from `Front` to ranking.
- Use `choice set underlying that shortlist` only when the mathematical set object itself is the point of the sentence.
- A reader should be able to recover on first pass what source set was acted on, what shortlist came out, and whether the text is naming the published set result, the token, or the mathematical set object.

### A.0:QF.2a - Set/space reading glosses

The current set/space reading terms should read plainly as follows:

- `SearchSpaceRef`
  - one declared reference to the `CharacteristicSpace` currently used to search, compare, or navigate candidate possibilities
  - it is one role-named ref field over the existing `CharacteristicSpaceRef` / `SpaceRef` idiom, not one brand-new space kind
- `OutcomeSpaceRef`
  - one declared reference to the `CharacteristicSpace` currently used to judge outcomes, effects, or realized value
  - it is one role-named ref field over that same idiom, not one synonym for `SearchSpaceRef`
- `DeclaredSubstrateInterpretiveView`
  - the ordinary/common head of one optional interpretive-view family laid over one already-declared substrate-bearing line or one source set or one set result whose substrate remains recoverable
  - it helps the reader see the current inspection question; it does not replace the base source set or silently invent one new substrate
- `DeclaredSubstrateAtlasView`
  - one richer optional interpretive view that keeps several declared views, spaces, mappings, or qualifiers visible together
  - use it only when the current reading truly needs that composite interpretation, and say why thinner interpretation is not enough; it is not the default meaning of palette, front, archive, shortlist, or candidate set
- `TypedSetViews`
  - one explicit list of which declared set-view heads the current atlas/support reading is holding together
  - use it when several declared views must stay visible together; it does not create one new set result and should not hide the active source set or active set result
- `OutcomeMapRef`
  - one explicit map reference showing how one declared source or set result bears on a declared outcome-side or effect-side space when that map materially matters
  - it qualifies the reading; it does not rename the source set into the outcome-side declared space/ref
- `SpaceMetricRef`
  - one explicit metric-ref qualifier for the metric, neighborhood, distance, density, or reachability discipline being used inside one declared space
  - it qualifies how the reader is comparing positions in that space; it is not the space itself and not one substitute for `SearchSpaceRef` or `OutcomeSpaceRef`
- `TransitionRelationRef`
  - one explicit transition-ref qualifier for the transition, cross-scale state-change, dynamic-coupling, or phase-change basis that the reading depends on
  - it explains why motion or cross-scale state change is being read a certain way; it does not by itself decide policy, planning, or publication
- `BridgeDistortionNote`
  - one explicit note that a bridge, projection, aggregation, or derived reading is useful but not perfectly faithful
  - it tells the reader where comparability bends or information is lost, so a reading that claims bridge, substitution, or reliance beyond the declared note does not over-claim

### A.0:QF.2b - Practitioner-facing reading cue

- If the question is “Which space are we searching or navigating?”, look for `SearchSpaceRef`.
- If the question is “Which space are we judging outcomes in?”, look for `OutcomeSpaceRef`.
- If the question is “What optional overlay helps me read several declared views or set results together?”, look for `DeclaredSubstrateInterpretiveView`.
- If that overlay also keeps several declared views, spaces, mappings, or qualifiers together, it is the richer `DeclaredSubstrateAtlasView`.
- If the atlas/support reading must keep several declared set views visible at once, look for `TypedSetViews`.
- If the overlay depends on one explicit source-to-outcome mapping, look for `OutcomeMapRef`.
- If the overlay depends on one metric, neighborhood, or reachability discipline inside one declared space, look for `SpaceMetricRef`.
- If the overlay depends on one transition, cross-scale state-change, or dynamic-coupling basis, look for `TransitionRelationRef`.
- If the overlay depends on one bridge or projection that may lose fidelity, look for `BridgeDistortionNote`.

### A.0:QF.2c - First-use classification check

- Start with `DeclaredSubstrateInterpretiveView` when the NQD/OEE task is simply to keep one declared palette, front, shortlist, or archive readable while comparing candidate material.
- Start with it only when any cited `SearchSpaceRef`, `OutcomeSpaceRef`, mappings, or qualifiers are already declared elsewhere and remain recoverable through the base substrate, source set, or set result.
- Escalate to `DeclaredSubstrateAtlasView` only when one named `InspectionQuestion` about the same declared substrate requires reading several declared views, spaces, mappings, or qualifiers together. State what their joint reading contributes to that question and why a thinner interpretation is insufficient; use `A.19.DECLARED-SUBSTRATE-INTERPRETIVE-VIEW` for the declaration.
- If the reading keeps several declared set views together, name `TypedSetViews` explicitly instead of letting atlas wording hide that view-set choice.
- If the reading depends on one source-to-outcome map, name `OutcomeMapRef` explicitly instead of letting the overlay silently stand in for that map.
- If the reading depends on one metric or neighborhood discipline, name `SpaceMetricRef` explicitly instead of letting the space name stand in for that metric.
- If the reading depends on one transition, cross-scale state-change, or dynamic-coupling basis, name `TransitionRelationRef` explicitly instead of letting the overlay silently absorb that transition-support requirement.
- Not this glossary-side interpretive-view stack when the real move is to invent one new search doctrine, one new outcome metric family, or one new publication surface. Those decisions stay with the governing patterns for the object itself.
