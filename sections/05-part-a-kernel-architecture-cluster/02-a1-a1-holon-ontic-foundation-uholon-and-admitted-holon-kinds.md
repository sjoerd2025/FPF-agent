### A.1:0 - Use This When

Use this pattern when a project must say what kind of thing is under concern before it can rely on parts, wholes, boundaries, acting systems, roles, methods, work, architecture, or descriptions.

Typical moments:

- a team calls everything a "system" and then asks physical or operational questions about theories, documents, models, dashboards, or descriptions;
- an episteme is treated as an acting agent that decides, performs work, authorizes, promises, or revises itself;
- a product, organization, machine, document family, research program, discipline, work occurrence, or model family must be treated as a whole with parts;
- a list, batch, fleet, pool, clientele, community, or supplier base is expected to act, but no acting system has been constructively recognized;
- architecture or selected-structure claims need the holon whose structure is being selected.

**Primary EntityOfConcern.** One exact `U.Entity` candidate whose actual construction may or may not satisfy the constructive recognition criterion for one already admitted holon kind.

**Primary working reader.** A practitioner or modeler who must decide whether part-whole, acting-system, or claim-bearing-holon reasoning is admissible for the exact entity under concern before relying on neighboring work, architecture, evidence, or publication claims.

**First useful move.** Name the exact `U.Entity` under concern. Then test whether its actual construction satisfies the A.1 holon-recognition criterion under an already admitted public holon kind. The kind is already admitted in the current FPF; `E.24.UK` governs the separate one-time decision to admit public U-kinds. The A.1 candidate test does not repeat that ontology decision.

When the next decision depends on which exact System acts, is intended to change, carries a capability, persists, or is being considered or designated as the project system-of-interest, use `A.1.SCR` to find that proposed subject. `A.1.SCR` first checks whether a non-system subject already answers the decision; apply the complete A.1 criterion only while the decision still depends on systemhood.

Once the exact proposed or observed focus is current, use `A.1.CSD` when the next question is which other Systems may undergo relevant changes and omitting one could change a named decision or investigation. That branch discovers candidate bearers and qualified consequence claims; it does not repeat recognition of the focus or settle causality, evaluation, or choice.

After recognition, use `A.1.STM` only when the remaining problem is loss of the long dependency from project use through architecture, Work, change, and recursive builders. Otherwise apply the rule that defines or tests the next claim.


**What goes wrong if missed.** A document edits itself, a theory gets ports, a list becomes an organization, a lathe that changes a workpiece is treated as its containing whole without an obtaining part-whole relation, and architecture is discussed without naming the holon whose structure is selected.

**What this buys.** FPF gets one compact part-whole foundation without turning every whole into a physical system: identity starts at `U.Entity`; part-whole treatment starts at `U.Holon`; acting work attaches to `U.System`; claim-bearing knowledge is carried by `U.Episteme`; method holonhood is governed by `U.Method`; other admitted holon kinds keep their own subject patterns.

**Not this pattern when.**

- If the current question is a selected bounded model-use relation organization, use `A.1.1`.
- If the current question is episteme identity, constitution, or neighboring-relation discipline, use `C.2.1`.
- If the current question is relation vocabulary or component, portion, aspect, and phase discipline, use `A.14`.
- If the current question is constructive part-whole grounding, use `C.13`; use `B.3.5` for Working-Model assurance grounding.
- If the current question is selected structure over a holon, use `A.22`.
- If the current question is architecture of a holon, use `C.30`.
- If the current question is transformation, method, system-role kind or assignment, work, capability, or functioning, use the subject pattern before relying on A.1.

### A.1:1 - Problem Frame

FPF cannot use `system` as its universal root. A pump, theory, software product, legal code, dashboard, research program, work occurrence, discipline, and team can all be objects under concern, but they do not all act, exchange matter, execute methods, or carry physical ports.

A.1 separates four questions that are often collapsed:

- **reference:** what can be individuated as `U.Entity`;
- **part-whole treatment:** which exact candidates satisfy the constructive recognition criterion for `U.Holon` or another already admitted public holon kind;
- **acting eligibility:** which recognized holons also satisfy the kind-specific criterion for the already admitted `U.System` kind;
- **claim-bearing knowledge:** which recognized holons also satisfy the kind-specific criterion for the already admitted `U.Episteme` kind.

Entity identity and world-side holon recognition have a context-independent base. Claim scope, effective reference scheme, and selected model-use structure can qualify a particular assertion or use, but none identifies the candidate, makes the constructive criterion true, or admits a public U-kind.

Other admitted holon kinds are not created by title, by filling one locally named slot, or by ordinary-language label. They remain governed by their direct patterns. Current accepted examples include `U.Method` under `A.3.1`, `U.Work` under `A.15.1`, and `U.Discipline` under `C.20`. `BoundedModelUseStructure` under `A.1.1` is `U.Structure`, not a holon kind.

### A.1:2 - Problem

Without A.1:

1. **System-bias spreads.** Physical and operational assumptions are projected onto epistemes, descriptions, theories, documents, dashboards, and source records.
2. **Epistemes become agents.** A document, model, theory, pattern, or report is said to decide, promise, authorize, perform work, or revise itself.
3. **Collections become collectives by wording.** A set of people, services, files, claims, assets, or suppliers is treated as an acting whole without boundary, coordination, system-role assignments, capability, method, or work evidence.
4. **Transformation becomes containment.** A system that changes another holon is treated as the larger whole containing it, or as standing in a part-whole relation to it, merely from that interaction.
5. **Architecture loses its grounding holon.** A structure, view, graph, diagram, or architecture claim floats free of the holon whose selected structure is under concern.
6. **Slot filling creates false kinds.** A system, episteme, holon, relation occurrence, or other value is given a new intrinsic kind merely because it fills one slot of a system-role assignment, evidence, publication, description, or another direct relation.

### A.1:3 - Forces

| Force | Tension |
| --- | --- |
| Universal root vs domain comfort | Practitioners know words such as system, model, product, team, document, program, and discipline; FPF needs a cross-domain root that does not import one domain's assumptions. |
| Identity vs composition | A thing can be individuated before FPF knows whether it has parts or belongs to a larger whole. |
| Acting vs claim-bearing | Systems can be classified by exact local system-role kinds, perform Work, and participate in separately governed system-role-assignment, Method-enactment, plan-use, publication, citation, comparison, or reliance relations. Changed claim content identifies another episteme under C.2.1. |
| Open-world modeling vs premature completion | A holon slot can be relevant even when not yet filled; omission means "not current or not recovered", not absence in the world. |
| Collection usefulness vs collective agency | Collections can have whole-level characteristics without being acting systems. |
| Architecture usefulness vs math-lens drift | Graphs, algebras, matrices, and embeddings can describe structures; they do not become the structure or holon by spelling. |

### A.1:4 - Solution

Use A.1 to distinguish an exact referenceable entity from a candidate that satisfies the constructive holon criterion under an already admitted public holon kind.

```text
U.Entity
  U.Holon
    U.System
    U.Episteme
    U.Method           only under A.3.1 and direct method-composition patterns
    U.Work             only under A.15.1
    U.Discipline       only under C.20
named C.3 U.Kind   only when the exact admission predicate defined in the subject pattern is satisfied
```

This is not a classical taxonomic ladder and not a publication hierarchy. `E.24.UK` is the pattern for public U-kind admission; A.1 is the pattern for recognition of exact candidates under the admitted holon kinds and the kind-specific patterns shown above. A selected `U.Structure`, including `BoundedModelUseStructure`, remains dependent relation organization rather than a holon kind.

#### A.1:4.1 - U.Entity

`U.Entity` is anything that can be individuated and referenced. It carries no part-whole, acting, claim-bearing, model-use, or architecture assumption by itself.

When observations may concern the same continuing entity and the next use depends on that identification, use A.1.RI. It constructs and compares connections under the entity's continuation criterion and the applicable subject and observation rules. An adequate available identification can be used directly.

Use `U.Entity` when the current move only needs to point to something—for example, a number, claim, named product, material batch, data value, legal clause, local system-role kind, reference, document, or another object under concern.

Do not apply holon aggregation, part-whole grounding, acting-system roles, or architecture claims to a bare `U.Entity` unless its actual construction satisfies the A.1 criterion for `U.Holon` or a kind-specific criterion for another already admitted public holon kind.

#### A.1:4.2 - U.Holon And Context-Independent Recognition

`U.Holon` is the broad part-whole EntityOfConcern: an exact `U.Entity` whose actual construction supports treatment as a whole with parts and as a possible part of a larger whole.

Keep ontology admission and candidate recognition separate. Use `E.24.UK` for the one-time FPF decision that admits `U.Holon` and every other public holon kind. A.1 is the pattern for the constructive criterion by which an exact candidate is recognized under an already admitted kind. `C.3.2` supplies three-valued discipline only for project-local kind membership; it does not own recognition under an admitted public holon kind. Candidate classification is a judgment about that exact entity; it is not a direct relation to a pattern edition, criterion episteme, evaluator, evidence set, or status value.

For one exact candidate, recover six distinct constructive components. Do not let one component stand in for another:

1. **Exact candidate.** Identify one exact `U.Entity` under its direct identity rule.
2. **Exact constituents.** Identify the entities claimed to constitute this candidate. Nearby entities, members of a set, sampled points, and arbitrary slices are not constituents by inclusion or wording.
3. **Constructive part relations and assembly.** Recover the exact obtaining part-relation occurrences under their direct patterns and the assembly by which those constituents compose this candidate. A list, diagram, or shared boundary does not establish those relations.
4. **Reidentification rule.** State the rule that distinguishes this whole and says which constituent, relation, boundary, or phase changes preserve or end its identity.
5. **Composition-grounded whole-level characteristic.** Recover at least one exact characteristic whose value or state is produced or sustained by the composition and is not attributable to one constituent alone.
6. **Possible participation in a larger constructive assembly.** Recover the candidate's actual boundary, interfaces, relevant characteristics, and identity-preservation conditions. Those facts must satisfy the applicability and compatibility conditions of at least one governed larger-assembly construction method or rule under which an admissible construction would include this candidate as a constituent while preserving its identity. One exact episteme may describe that method or state that rule and its conditions.

Name the already admitted holon kind and its direct kind-specific pattern separately from those six components. The candidate satisfies the A.1 criterion when all six world-side components hold and any kind-specific condition is satisfied; it fails when a required component or condition does not hold. Satisfaction or failure does not vary with current evidence availability or evaluator access. Replacing a constituent or part-relation occurrence preserves the same holon only when the reidentification rule admits that change. An unassembled collection fails even when a project card calls it a holon.

Exact dated classification work belongs to `A.15.1`. When a reusable typed recognition-evaluation operation is current, `A.6.1` governs its declared arguments and result plus the actual application bindings. The evaluation returns `true` when its governed inputs determine satisfaction, `false` when they determine failure, and `unknown` when missing evidence or an unavailable dependency prevents either determination. `unknown` is an evaluation result, not a third candidate state: the same candidate can satisfy or fail the criterion while the current evaluation remains unable to determine which.

When another use must inspect or cite the judgment, identify an optional C.2.1 classification-assertion or evaluation-result episteme whose exact EntityOfConcern is the candidate. Its claim content names the admitted kind, the A.1 criterion, the constituent and part-relation facts, reidentification rule, whole-level characteristic, candidate-side compatibility facts, exact construction-method-or-rule episteme, evaluation frame, and `true | false | unknown` judgment needed by that use.

A person or system performing the receiving work separately decides whether to rely, decline to rely, defer, or reopen. Exact evidence and assurance relations support or warrant assertion claim content. Use G.11 to test whether the selected assertion edition is current. `B.2` addresses the different question whether the existing whole is no longer the right EntityOfConcern for a receiving use. A.1 satisfaction, failure, or evaluation uncertainty supplies neither warrant for a B.2 claim nor grounds for selecting B.2.

In ordinary use, stop after naming the exact entity being evaluated, six constructive components, admitted kind, kind-specific condition, and resulting judgment needed by the task. Materialize a classification assertion only when a specific downstream task must inspect or cite that judgment. If a system-thinking long map consumes the result, pass only this recognition result and apply A.1.STM; do not add external value, project designation, architecture, Work, or network selection to the A.1 criterion.

**Historical read path.** Older FPF writing may use `super-holon`. Under `F.13`, read it either as the larger system of which `S` is an admitted part under one exact part-whole relation, or as the rejected inference that interaction, change, control, teaching, measurement, or repair alone makes such containment obtain. Current FPF does not use that historical expression as a head. `Environment` means the exact external referents and crossing relations made relevant by a stated system delimitation and use; a medium is named as such only when that exact medium is the subject. Neither denotes a generic `Context` or identifies a containing whole. An actual containing-system claim names the larger system and the exact obtaining part-whole relation.

#### A.1:4.3 - Admitted Holon Kinds

Current accepted holon-kind examples are:

- `U.System`, used here for an acting physical or operational holon;
- `U.Episteme`, used here only for a non-agentive claim-bearing holon, identified under C.2.1 by exact claim content, EntityOfConcern, and effective ReferenceScheme, with constitution, empirical grounding, and edition kept as distinct direct relations;
- `U.Work`, admitted under `A.15.1` for a dated 4D occurrence holon;
- `U.Discipline`, defined in `C.20` as a field-level practice-and-knowledge holon;
- `U.Method`, defined in `A.3.1`, with method-composition patterns such as `B.1.5` defining how submethods compose into a whole method across levels.

A project-local holon classification names its concrete C.3 `U.Kind`, the A.1 criterion, any kind-specific criterion, and the direct patterns for the construction facts it uses. A proposed public `U.*` holon kind first passes `E.24.UK` and gains one subject pattern. Neither route may rely on part-whole, architecture, system-role-kind classification or assignment, work, evidence, or source-use claims before the candidate-side criterion is recoverable.

Candidate recognition is decided by the six candidate-side constructive components in A.1:4.2, not by agentivity, wording, evidence availability, or a B.2 whole-reidentification result. Grounding work selects the participating objects from the surrounding practice or world, fixes their boundaries, identifies constituents and exact part relations, recovers the assembly and reidentification rule, and tests the resulting whole-level characteristic and larger-assembly compatibility. Relations may arrange, constrain, assign, qualify, or describe constituents; those relations do not become constituents by that fact.

`U.Method` and a local system-role kind are not decided by whether they act. `U.Episteme` already shows that a non-agentive object can be a holon. `U.Method` is a non-agentive holon kind: submethods can compose into whole methods with whole-level preconditions, effects, invariants, interfaces, constraints, and assurance hooks, and a whole method can participate in a larger method. A step label or step description is not a method part by label: first recover a `U.Method` submethod rather than a method-description node, order relation, work-plan item, or work occurrence. A local system-role kind is instead an exact local `U.Kind` whose candidates are `U.System` values; it is neither a public root U-kind nor a holon kind by kind identity. C.3 recovers it through the candidate domain, operative condition for a stable, assignable, work-facing contribution, intended member/non-member boundary, and continuity rule. A practice or source reference only locates or prompts comparison of the definition; the current `KindSignature` states the candidate-side condition against direct features of the system. Assignment may be one criterion only when that signature says so; assignment alone does not confer family-wide membership. The assignment occurrence, assignment state, capability, responsibility, permission, commitment, obligation, method participation, and `SystemRoleKindRelationStructure` remain neighboring objects or relations rather than parts of the kind.

#### A.1:4.4 - U.System

`U.System` is an acting physical or operational holon kind. It can participate in system-role assignments, capability relations, method enactment, mechanism realization, work occurrences, transformations, functioning relations, and responsibility-bearing claims when their direct patterns make those claims current.

Its kind-specific condition is acting eligibility: the recognized whole has an actual physical or operational organization through which it can causally participate in work or transformation while preserving its identity. Capability evidence or actual participation can support a classification assertion; a `U.SystemRoleAssignment`, work occurrence, or capability relation does not create the system by participation alone.

Keep those relations separate:

- Use `A.2.1` to state the `U.SystemRoleAssignment` occurrence whose `HolderSystemSlot` is filled by the system.
- `A.2.2` governs capability claims about that system.
- `A.3.1`, `A.3.2`, and the mechanism family govern method, method description, and mechanism realization.
- `A.15.1` governs independently admitted performed Work; recover its actual performer's agency basis through A.13, and use F.6 only when precise assignment-bound attribution is needed.
- `A.3.4` governs the bounded transformation; the exact direct subject-relation pattern defines or constrains the system's participation in it.
- Functioning, evidence, assurance, temporal, and dynamics claims remain with their direct patterns.

A.1 introduces no omnibus participation relation over references to all those occurrences. Listing them together in a worked case creates no additional world-side relation. If the selected organization among several direct relations changes an engineering decision, select that organization as `U.Structure` under A.22 and keep every constituent occurrence under its direct identity. Claim scope, effective reference scheme, and optional model-use structure qualify each dependent assertion only where its direct pattern makes them current.

#### A.1:4.5 - U.Episteme

`U.Episteme` is a claim-bearing, non-agentive holon kind. Acting systems can use, cite, publish, represent, structure, compare, interpret, or rely on it through separately governed relations. Work may yield another edition, but changed claim content identifies another episteme under C.2.1 rather than an in-place transformation of the same one.

Use `C.2.1` for episteme identity, `EpistemeConstitutionRelation`, and the direct empirical-grounding and edition relations declared there. Use the neighboring direct patterns for viewpoint, view, claim scope, bounded model use, evidence, publication, source use, carrier, and representation. A.1 only says that an episteme can be treated as a holon when part-whole treatment of the claim-bearing object is current.

A system may decide, approve, perform work, promise, revise, authorize, or bear responsibility through separately governed relations and Work. Classification by a local system-role kind or an assignment to it supplies none of those acts, permissions, commitments, or responsibilities by itself.

#### A.1:4.6 - Recover Holon Delimitation And Boundary Crossing

When a claim concerns where a holon is delimited, recover the delimitation relation, criterion, or selected structure supplied by the direct holon, mereology, architecture, or domain pattern. Do not force an identity rule, collection-belonging relation, environment relation, selected structure, and boundary condition into one universal relation signature. Those objects have different kinds and predicates.

When one direct relation crosses that delimitation, keep the direct relation occurrence under its own pattern. State the delimited holon, the direct crossing relation, direction, fit, loss, scope, and qualification window that are current for that use. When the claim also needs a semantic correspondence or difference between two exact F.17 local senses from different semantic contexts, use F.9 for that Bridge question. A crossing classification does not replace the signal, control, measurement, transformation, source-use, publication-use, evidence-use, coupling, or other direct relation occurrence.

Do not call every boundary an interface. Use interface language only when a governing signature, module, architecture, port, or interface pattern makes interface meaning current.

External holon vocabularies do not admit FPF kinds or establish candidate holonhood by label. Recover the current FPF claim first. Acting-agent and organization claims test the `U.System` criterion; data, document, and projected-content claims usually use `U.Episteme`, publication, source-use, evidence, or description rules; process-holon wording uses work, method, work-plan, or transformation rules; portal or traversal wording uses an access, crossing, policy, or evidence relation. An exact candidate-side holon or system claim passes only when the A.1 criterion is satisfied.

A Markov blanket is not a holon boundary by name. First recover whether the source names accepted local Markov dynamics, a mathematical or probabilistic lens, an exact holon-delimitation claim, a physical interface module or component, a functional element, a boundary description, or an agency-threshold claim. Apply the rule that defines or tests that recovered claim. The exact candidate is a holon under A.1 only when its constructive criterion is satisfied; the neighboring delimitation claim does not establish holonhood.

#### A.1:4.7 - Collections, Collection-As-Whole, And Acting Collectives

A list, set, batch, fleet, pool, clientele, community, supplier base, or coverage zone does not become a `U.System` by wording.

First recover the current claim: who or what belongs to which collection under the collection's own rule and A.14; a possible holon under the complete six-part A.1 test; a `C.13 set` account of already established belonging; optional B.3.5 assurance; a whole-level characteristic under C.16; an acting collective under the `U.System` criterion plus A.15.1 Work; or whole reidentification under B.2.

An acting collective `U.System` has a boundary, coordination, system-role assignments, capability or method evidence, and work-facing participation. If those are not current, keep the object as a collection or collection-as-whole claim under subject patterns.

#### A.1:4.8 - Constructional Grounding

A.1 governs constructive holon recognition. Exact part-relation patterns govern part relations; C.13 governs constructional grounding; E.24.UK governs public-kind admission.

Use A.14 and the direct relation patterns to identify collection belonging and any independently obtaining component, portion, aspect, phase, constituent, or other constructive part relation. Use C.13 to report how already grounded facts form a collection, assemble the candidate, or distinguish an aspect. If a C.13 trace is materialized, it is a C.2.1 episteme about that construction. Use B.3.5 only when a named assurance use elects its profile.

Systems, epistemes, methods, dated work occurrences, and disciplines are admitted holon kinds under their direct patterns. C.13 may describe their construction only after those patterns supply exact parts and whole-forming relations for the candidate. A selected `U.Structure`, including `BoundedModelUseStructure`, organizes already identified relations for a use; selection or a diagram gives it no constituents, parthood, agency, holonhood, or B.2 transition.

FPF avoids unrestricted composition. A set of nearby objects, graph, diagram, system-role-kind or assignment bundle, method algebra, work breakdown, or source table does not become a holon merely because it can be listed or represented as a whole. Several independently identified transformations likewise do not become parts of one composite transformation from shared timing, a changed referent, a method or work decomposition, or a C.13 trace. When the work requires positive transformation composition or transformation holonhood and no direct composition pattern supplies the candidate whole, constituents, contribution, compatibility, and reidentification rule, retain the exact blocker and stop before A.1 classification.

#### A.1:4.9 - Slot Filling Does Not Create A Kind

A system that fills `HolderSystemSlot` of a `U.SystemRoleAssignment` occurrence remains a system. An episteme that participates as the EntityOfConcern in an `EpistemeConstitutionRelation` remains an episteme. A system can participate in a transformation through an exact governed direct relation without thereby becoming a part of the changed holon or the larger whole containing it. A holon that participates as the EntityOfConcern of a structure-description episteme remains that holon rather than becoming the description.

The SlotSpec belongs to the direct relation declaration. Its SlotKind names the local participant slot; its ValueKind constrains admissible fillers. Filling that slot establishes neither a new intrinsic kind for the filler nor a new relation occurrence unless the direct obtaining predicate and identity rule are also satisfied. Use the subject pattern before introducing any durable kind name.

### A.1:5 - Archetypal Grounding (Worked Cases)

#### A.1:5.1 - Pump As Acting System

Use this illustrative engineering case to decide whether Pump #37 qualifies as a `U.System`. Take the following construction and operating facts as the case inputs:

- Pump #37 is the assembly initially built from casing C37, impeller I37, seal S37, motor M37, inlet flange FI37, and outlet flange FO37. Each is a physical component of that pump under A.14 `ComponentOf`.
- C37 encloses I37; M37 is bolted to C37 and its shaft is coupled to I37; S37 seals the shaft entry; FI37 and FO37 are fastened to C37 and open into its water passage. These obtaining fastening, enclosure, coupling, sealing, and connection relations assemble the named components as one pump.
- The case's installed-assembly reidentification rule preserves Pump #37 through shutdown, temporary disassembly, and replacement of S37 by S38 with the same mating geometry and operating limits, provided C37 is retained and the assembly and its inlet/outlet boundaries are restored before return to service. Replacing C37 or permanently dismantling the assembly ends Pump #37 under this rule.
- With water at 20 °C and a 400 V, 50 Hz supply, this assembly sustains a flow of 10 m³/h against a pressure rise of 200 kPa. The coupled motor, impeller, casing, and sealed passage produce that whole-pump response; no one component supplies it alone.
- `U.System` is already an admitted public U-kind in FPF; `E.24.UK` governs admission of public U-kinds. The pump's physical organization can cause the stated water-moving change while retaining its identity, supplying the kind-specific acting-eligibility condition.

For the larger-assembly test, `CW-Install-1` is the case's governed plant-installation rule. It integrates the intact pump as the replaceable circulation unit of CoolingLoop-2: bolt its feet to the loop support, connect FI37 to the loop's return port and FO37 to its supply port, and connect M37 to the electrical supply. Compare its applicability conditions with the remaining case facts:

| CW-Install-1 condition | Pump #37 fact |
| --- | --- |
| Each water port must mate with a 50 mm bore flange having four 12 mm bolt holes on a 90 mm bolt circle. | FI37 and FO37 each have that bore and hole geometry. |
| The support accepts four mounting holes on a 120 × 180 mm rectangle and a pump mass of at most 40 kg. | The pump's feet have that hole pattern; the intact pump has a mass of 35 kg. |
| With the available 400 V, 50 Hz supply and water at 20 °C, the pump must sustain at least 8 m³/h against a pressure rise of 200 kPa. | The stated whole-pump response is 10 m³/h at that pressure rise under those conditions. |
| Installation must retain the casing, internal assembly, and pump-side inlet/outlet boundaries. | The rule uses the existing mounting holes and flanges; it changes only the external attachments, preserving Pump #37 under the stated reidentification rule. |

These facts supply one larger-assembly witness: CW-Install-1's conditions are satisfied and its construction preserves the pump as a constituent. Together with the identified candidate, components, assembly, reidentification rule, whole-level response, and acting eligibility, they establish the A.1 criterion for this illustrative `U.System` case. A classification evaluation given these inputs returns `true`; a separate C.2.1 assertion may state that result.

The candidate-side facts and the available evaluation inputs remain distinct. If the mass fact is withheld and no other input resolves the compatibility question, evaluation returns `unknown`; withholding that fact changes neither the pump nor whether the criterion holds. Replacing S37 by the specified S38 preserves Pump #37 through the admitted maintenance phase. Replacing C37 instead requires identifying the resulting assembly as another candidate under this case's rule.

If the intact candidate instead has a mass of 45 kg, CW-Install-1 cannot supply the sixth component because its support limit is 40 kg. A coupling, load-envelope, or boundary-interface violation likewise defeats that installation rule even when the drawing and rule-description episteme are current. Failure of this one rule does not settle the existential larger-assembly condition: the candidate fails that component only if none of the governed larger-assembly constructions has conditions satisfied by its actual facts. Evaluation returns `false` when its inputs determine that failure, and `unknown` when the searched methods or available facts do not settle it. Renaming or republishing the cited criterion pattern does not change Pump #37 or those facts; any change to the episteme's designation, edition, or currentness remains separately governed.

Separate direct relations then state that Pump #37 fills the holder-system slot of its cooling-water circulation `U.SystemRoleAssignment`, has a flow-rate capability envelope, and participates in the water-moving transformation. A separate inspection account may identify `WO-1842 : U.Work`, but the cooling-water assignment does not make Pump #37 its performer: the exact inspector System must have its own A.13 core, the Work must be independently admitted under A.15.1, and F.6 is added only if that account needs precise assignment-bound attribution through the inspector's same obtaining assignment. Pump #37 remains the inspected or participating subject unless another direct performer basis establishes otherwise. No omnibus participation or candidate-classification relation is added. The pump can have selected structures; its maintenance model may participate in a separately selected `BoundedModelUseStructure`, but that structure neither identifies the pump nor makes it a holon.

#### A.1:5.2 - Scientific Theory As Episteme Holon

This schematic illustration concerns Newtonian gravitation in one exact selected edition, first identified as a C.2.1 `U.Episteme` candidate. Its actual claim-bearing constitution can satisfy the A.1 criterion for the already admitted `U.Episteme` kind when the following facts obtain:

- exact law, definition, derivation, diagram, exercise, and evidence-relation epistemes are the candidate constituents;
- exact claim-composition and episteme part relations organize those constituents as one governed claim-bearing whole;
- C.2.1 identifies this theory episteme by its exact claim content, EntityOfConcern, and effective ReferenceScheme; a change to any of these identifies another episteme. Historical continuation between the earlier and later epistemes requires a separate `EpistemeEditionRelation` under an applicable edition-continuity rule;
- inferential and explanatory characteristics arise from the organized claim-bearing whole rather than from one constituent;
- its actual inferential interfaces, effective reference scheme, applicability conditions, and identity-preservation conditions satisfy the applicability and compatibility conditions of at least one governed method for composing it as a constituent of a larger explanatory or educational episteme;
- `U.Episteme` is already an admitted public U-kind in FPF; `E.24.UK` governs admission of public U-kinds, while C.2.1 supplies the kind-specific constitution condition.

For a particular theory, supply the constituent identities and an independently obtaining direct episteme-part or claim-composition predicate before drawing the recognition conclusion (C.13:5.3). A textbook publication can make this edition available, but the publication form and the episteme that describes the composition method do not create the theory's compatibility or holonhood. Classification work may evaluate the criterion and a separate C.2.1 assertion may state the result; evidence, warrant, edition currentness, receiving reliance, and any B.2 whole-reidentification question remain separately governed.

A system under an exact `U.SystemRoleAssignment` may explain, publish, compare, or use this episteme through separately governed Work and relation occurrences; the assignment alone establishes none of those acts. Revision Work yields another episteme, with any edition relation tested separately.

#### A.1:5.3 - Fleet As Collection Or Acting Collective

A fleet register supports the claim that a vehicle belongs to the fleet only under its registration rule. In the register-only case the fleet is not thereby established as a holon: no vehicle-to-whole assembly or composition-grounded characteristic is claimed. Fleet availability is a separate collection characteristic. A fleet-coordination organization that coordinates vehicles, drivers, rules, and Work can be an acting collective `U.System` only after all six A.1 matters, including its constructive relations and assembly, have been recovered.

If a source says "the fleet responded", recover the actual claim: individual vehicle work, fleet-coordination system work, collection-as-whole characteristic, or B.2 whole reidentification.

#### A.1:5.4 - Lathe Changing A Workpiece

A lathe can change a workpiece during manufacturing without thereby becoming a part of the workpiece or the larger whole containing it.

Use `A.3.4` to identify the bounded transformation from the exact changed referent, extent, boundary conditions, actual change facts, and continuity rule. Use the direct subject patterns for the lathe's participation, method, dated work, work-to-change facts, and evidence. Use A.14 or C.13 for part-whole only when an exact grounded part relation independently obtains.

#### A.1:5.5 - Stop Before A Whole Is Constructed

A pallet holding an unconnected pump, motor, baseframe, and manifold is a collection of exact entities. The list and physical proximity do not supply the fastening, coupling, enclosure, connection, assembly, or reidentification facts needed to recognize a skid holon. A construction drawing is an episteme about a possible assembly.

A selected `BoundedModelUseStructure` may organize model-applicability, delimitation, maintenance, and crossing relations for an engineering use. It remains dependent `U.Structure`; selecting it, naming it, or drawing it supplies no part relations, whole-level characteristic, acting eligibility, or B.2 whole reidentification.

Mounting, wiring, and fluid-connection changes may each be exact `U.Transformation` occurrences. Their participation in one work episode or one flow description does not identify a composite transformation. Without a direct transformation-composition governor, retain the separate changes and stop before transformation parthood, composite identity, or A.1 holon recognition. This stop does not say that the changes are atomic or have no finer parts.

### A.1:6 - Bias-Annotation

Relevant lenses: **Onto**, **Arch**, **Epist**, **Prag**, **Gov**, **Did**.

This pattern intentionally resists:

- **system-bias:** treating all objects as acting physical systems;
- **episteme-agent bias:** assigning work, authority, or decision to claim-bearing epistemes;
- **collection-bias:** treating any collection as an acting collective;
- **boundary-bias:** treating boundary words, diagrams, folders, or sections as holon delimitation by appearance;
- **interaction-bias:** using one word for transformation, signal, source use, publication use, evidence relation, probe relation, and control relation;
- **math-lens drift:** treating graph, algebra, matrix, tuple, or embedding expressions as the ontology-side structure by spelling;
- **publication-form bias:** treating a document, dashboard, model, register, or digital twin as the holon it describes.

### A.1:7 - Conformance Checklist

| Check | Conformance condition |
| --- | --- |
| `CC-A1-1` | The exact candidate is first individuated as `U.Entity`; the public holon kind is already admitted in FPF before the candidate is tested against A.1. `E.24.UK` governs admission of public U-kinds; A.1 does not repeat that decision or require its result as a candidate-test input. |
| `CC-A1-2` | A current recognition use separately recovers the exact candidate, exact constituents, constructive part-relation occurrences and assembly, reidentification rule, composition-grounded whole-level characteristic, and candidate-side compatibility with an applicable governed larger-assembly construction method or rule; it then names the already admitted holon kind and its direct kind-specific condition. |
| `CC-A1-3` | A proposed new public holon kind first passes `E.24.UK`; its direct pattern then states the kind-specific membership condition without changing the common A.1 criterion for exact candidates. |
| `CC-A1-4` | Candidate classification is not reified as a status relation. World-side satisfaction or failure, classification work, `true | false | unknown` evaluation, optional C.2.1 assertion identity, evidence or warrant, G.11 edition currentness, receiving-work disposition, and B.2 whole reidentification remain separately governed; no A.1 result warrants a B.2 claim or selects B.2. |
| `CC-A1-5` | System-role-kind classification, `U.SystemRoleAssignment`, capability, method, work, transformation, functioning, evidence, and temporal claims remain separate; their reference bundle is not asserted as another occurrence. |
| `CC-A1-6` | `U.Episteme` is non-agentive. Systems may publish, cite, use, or perform revision Work concerning epistemes, but changed claim content identifies another episteme and any edition relation is separately governed. |
| `CC-A1-7` | Collection belonging under the collection's own rule, a possible holon, an acting collective System, a whole-level characteristic, and B.2 whole reidentification are kept distinct. |
| `CC-A1-8` | Boundary wording recovers an exact delimitation relation, criterion, or selected structure from its direct pattern; crossing wording preserves the exact crossing relation occurrence without minting universal delimitation or crossing relation kinds. F.9 applies when the claim needs a semantic correspondence or difference between two exact F.17 local senses from different semantic contexts. |
| `CC-A1-9` | Changing, controlling, teaching, measuring, or repairing another holon does not make that holon a part of the acting system; any actual containing-whole claim names a separately grounded part-whole relation. |
| `CC-A1-10` | A.14 and the direct part-relation patterns identify exact obtaining parthood; C.13 may ground an assembly only from those facts and does not create them; use B.3.5 only for a named assurance use. |
| `CC-A1-11` | Publication forms, construction traces, and descriptions of holons remain distinct from the holons and world-side construction facts they describe. |
| `CC-A1-12` | A candidate `U.System`, `U.Episteme`, `U.Method`, `U.Work`, or `U.Discipline` may use constructive grounding only after its direct patterns identify exact parts and whole-forming relations; a selected dependent `U.Structure` is not a holon by selection or name. |
| `CC-A1-13` | Several actual changes are not classified as one composite transformation or holon without a direct transformation-composition governor; a missing governor neither proves composition nor proves atomism. |


### A.1:8 - Common Anti-Patterns and How to Avoid Them

| Anti-pattern | Symptom | Repair |
| --- | --- | --- |
| System as universal root | A theory, document, model, source, or dashboard receives physical system properties. | Re-type as `U.Episteme`, publication, source-use object, or another direct object before using system claims. |
| Document edited itself | A model, theory, or document is said to perform a revision. | Name the revising `U.System`. If the account claims revision Work, first recover that System's A.13 core—local agential system-role kind and criterion, classification, and obtaining assignment with the required scope, situation, and window—then use A.15.1 to admit the Work. A short account may omit restating these facts only when they remain recoverable; add F.6 only for precise assignment-bound attribution. Changed claim content identifies another `U.Episteme`; test any edition relation separately, and distinguish publication or carrier changes under their own patterns. |
| Collection as actor | A list, batch, pool, fleet, or community is said to decide or perform Work. | Recover who or what belongs to the collection under its own rule, a possible holon, a whole-level characteristic, an acting collective System, or B.2 whole reidentification. |
| Interaction as one umbrella | Signal, source use, publication use, transformation, measurement, and control are all called interaction. | Recover the exact direct relation; use F.9 for a needed semantic correspondence or difference between two exact local senses from different semantic contexts, and `A.3.4` when bounded change is current. |
| Omnibus participation relation | References to system-role-kind classification or assignment, capability, method, work, transformation, evidence, and time are packed into one additional relation-shaped record. | Keep the direct relation occurrences separate; select their organization as `U.Structure` only when that organization changes the receiving use. |
| Boundary by drawing | A box, folder, section, dashboard view, or diagram is treated as the holon boundary. | Recover the exact delimitation relation, criterion, or selected structure from its direct pattern; keep the drawing as a description or view. |
| Architecture without holon | A selected structure is discussed without the holon whose structure is selected. | Use A.1 to name the holon, then `A.22` and `C.30` for selected structure and architecture. |

### A.1:9 - Consequences

Positive consequences:

- FPF can talk about physical systems, organizations, documents, theories, models, work occurrences, disciplines, research programs, and selected structures without making them all systems or holons.
- Acting work stays attached to systems in roles.
- Epistemes can be described, compared, published, and relied on; revision Work yields another episteme when claim content changes.
- Architecture and selected-structure claims gain a grounding holon.
- Collection-as-whole and acting collective claims become inspectable instead of lexical.

Costs:

- Practitioners pay the cost of replacing umbrella uses of "system", "boundary", "interaction", "level", "emergence", and "collection" with exact governed claims.
- A reviewable holon-recognition claim states the exact constituents, construction, reidentification, larger-assembly compatibility, whole-level characteristic, admitted kind, and subject pattern on which it relies.
- Some familiar sentences need repair: "the document decided" becomes a claim about the deciding `U.System`, the direct decision relation or admitted Work, and an episteme or publication. A Work claim requires the A.13 performer core even when a short account leaves it recoverable rather than restating it; an ordinary direct decision or change account stays with its subject pattern.

### A.1:10 - Rationale

A.1 prevents category errors by separating individuation, constructive part-whole recognition, acting eligibility, and claim-bearing. `U.Entity` gives the minimal referenceable object. `U.Holon` adds six separately recoverable constructive components: exact candidate, exact constituents, exact part relations and assembly, reidentification, a composition-grounded whole-level characteristic, and compatible possible participation in a governed larger assembly. `U.System` adds acting eligibility. `U.Episteme` adds claim-bearing structure without agentivity. `U.Work` and `U.Discipline` are holon-kind examples only through their subject patterns; `BoundedModelUseStructure` is selected `U.Structure`, not another holon kind.

The recognition base cannot depend on a prior context object without recursion. It begins with the exact candidate and world-side construction facts. Public-kind admission is the separate one-time `E.24.UK` decision. Classification work may evaluate the criterion, but its `true | false | unknown` result, a C.2.1 assertion, evidence, currentness, and receiving disposition neither participate in a candidate-side relation nor alter the candidate's identity.

This also prevents ontology duplication. A theory under concern, a theory description, a publication of that description, and the system that edits the publication can all be named without turning the filling of one participant slot into a new kind. Architecture likewise starts from the exact holon recognized under an admitted kind whose selected structures matter; diagrams and structure descriptions remain epistemes.

The constructional stance is conservative: FPF avoids unrestricted composition and uses A.14 and C.13 before a part-whole claim is relied on for another claim or work occurrence; B.3.5 is added only when a named assurance use elects its profile. This keeps holonic thinking useful without letting every collection, expression, graph, selected structure, or source label become a holon.

### A.1:11 - SoTA-Echoing

A.1 draws on current constructional-ontology, applied-foundational-ontology, and physics-side construction traditions for different questions. None of these sources admits an FPF kind, establishes a candidate's construction, or replaces the direct patterns that define or constrain part relations, work, evidence, or publication.

| Current source and practice answer | Exact use in A.1 | Adoption status and blocked overread |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Florio and Linnebo, [*Introduction to Constructional Ontology*](https://philarchive.org/rec/FLOITC-3), 2024, distinguish constructors, constructor inputs, constructional processes, and the identity consequences of construction choices. | A.1 requires exact constituents, obtaining constructive part relations, assembly, reidentification, and a composition-grounded whole-level characteristic before recognizing a candidate whole. | **Adapt.** A.1 adopts construction-sensitive identity but keeps public-kind admission with `E.24.UK` and direct subject facts with their own patterns; a construction description or selected constructor does not make the candidate a holon. |
| Borgo and Righetti, [“Towards Applied Constructional Ontology”](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.3233/FAIA250480), FOIS 2025, show that applying constructional ontology still requires explicit choices about mereology, dependence, and identity. | A.1 requires A.14 for exact part-relation vocabulary and C.13 for constructive grounding, preserves a separate reidentification rule, and uses B.3.5 only when assurance grounding is current. | **Adopt.** The demand for explicit applied choices is adopted; A.1 rejects the shortcut that a constructional-ontology label already settles constituents, parthood, whole identity, or warrant. |
| Deutsch, [*Constructor Theory*](https://arxiv.org/abs/1210.7439), 2012, and Deutsch and Marletto, [“Constructor theory of time”](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08692), 2025, treat possible transformations through substrate attributes and constructor conditions rather than through a written task alone. | A.1's larger-assembly component requires the candidate's actual boundary, interfaces, relevant characteristics, and identity-preservation conditions to satisfy the applicability and compatibility conditions of a governed construction method or rule. | **Adapt.** The modal discipline is adopted for candidate recognition; a task, rule episteme, drawing, or evidence item does not create applicability, compatibility, possibility, work, or assembly. |
| Partridge, [*BORO Ontology*](https://borosolutions.net/boro-ontology), C-FORS 2025, supplies a current 4D extensional and unrestricted-composition comparator. | A.1 makes identity through change and actual construction explicit, while using A.14 and C.13 before relying on a part-whole claim. | **Reject wholesale; retain the identity test.** A.1 rejects unrestricted composition and import of BORO's category system, while retaining pressure to state the exact candidate, extent-sensitive reidentification, and construction facts. |

For the Pump #37 and scientific-theory cases in A.1:5, the practical consequence is the same: recover the candidate and its subject-side construction first; use a governed method or rule only to test larger-assembly compatibility; keep evaluation, evidence, assertion, description, and publication as separately governed neighboring objects.

Treat a stronger source as current only when it changes the root split among `U.Entity`, `U.Holon`, `U.System`, admitted holon kinds, delimitation, boundary crossing, or publication-form separation. A new tool, notation, or diagram style is not enough unless it changes that ontology-side claim.

### A.1:12 - Relations

- **A.1.RI** develops reidentification across observations and supplies a supported identifying result or the alternatives still relevant to use.

- **Builds on:** `E.24.UK` for one-time public U-kind admission, `A.14` and `C.13` for exact part relations and constructive assembly, and `B.3.5` when Working-Model assurance grounding is current.
- **Coordinates with:** `A.1.STM` only after recognition when the current problem is use of the system-thinking long attention map; `A.15.1` for dated classification work; `A.6.1` for a current typed evaluation operation and actual bindings; `C.2.1` for classification-assertion or evaluation-result episteme identity; `A.10` and `B.3` for evidence and warrant; `G.11` for assertion-edition currentness; `B.2` for the separate whole-reidentification question; `A.1.1` for bounded model-use structure; `A.22` for selected structure; `C.30` for architecture; `A.3.4` for transformation; `C.20` for discipline; and `E.10.ARCH` for wording-use restoration.
- **Applied by:** Use `A.1.SCR` when a practitioner must find the exact acting or changed System for a decision that depends on systemhood. After an exact proposed or observed focus is current, use `A.1.CSD` when the next question is which other Systems may undergo relevant changes. Use `A.1.STM` only when the practitioner still cannot connect a recognized project System to the long dependency map. For a direct Work, Method, capability, structure, episteme, or relation question, apply the pattern that defines or tests that claim instead of invoking this complete criterion.
- **Used by:** patterns that need an exact recognized holon, an already admitted holon kind, an acting system, a non-agentive episteme, a grounded part-whole claim, a collection-versus-collective distinction, a delimitation relation, or a boundary-crossing relation.
