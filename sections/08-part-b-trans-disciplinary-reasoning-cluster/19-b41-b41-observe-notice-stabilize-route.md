## B.4.1 - Observe -> Notice -> Stabilize -> Route

> **Type:** Architectural (A)
> **Status:** Stable
> **Normativity:** Normative unless marked informative

**Plain-name.** Observe-to-route seam.

### B.4.1:1 - Problem frame
Observation rarely yields a ready anomaly, `A.6.A` invitation, or hypothesis in one step. Between low-articulation cue preservation and endpoint assertions under exact subject predicates, the cluster needs one explicit route-bearing seam that can publish route plurality or route selection without pretending that the cue already satisfies an endpoint predicate.

That seam begins **after cue stabilization**, with `U.PreArticulationCuePack` or an equivalent early form under `A.16`. Cue preservation may exist before routing. `B.4.1` begins only when route publication itself becomes worth making explicit.

### B.4.1:2 - Problem
Without a pre-abductive seam, early cue publications are either lost, prematurely forced into late forms such as `AnomalyStatement`, `Characteristic`, `ActionOption`, or requirement language, or they smuggle route selection into cue-pack prose with no explicit route-subject assertion, predicate, and pattern locator.

### B.4.1:3 - Forces
| Force | Tension |
|---|---|
| **Early capture vs endpoint discipline** | Preserve low-articulation cues without collapsing route discipline. |
| **Plural route set vs explicit selection** | Permit multiple candidate routes while still requiring an explicit selection record when selection occurs. |
| **Seam clarity vs new-type inflation** | Add a real seam without creating an uncontrolled zoo of new publication kinds. |
| **Form vs face precision** | Keep route-bearing publication form distinct from the MVPK face on which it is rendered. |

### B.4.1:4 - Solution
Use this seam to make the candidate continuations and any selected route explicit after cue stabilization. The pre-abductive route-bearing seam sits inside the language-state cluster, between observation/cue preservation and endpoint subject-pattern entries:

`Observe -> Notice -> Stabilize -> Route`

Publish the route package as a `RoutedCueSet`, normally downstream of `U.PreArticulationCuePack`.

A robust route package should identify:

- the **originating cue pack**, if any, or the equivalent early form preserving the stabilized cue,
- the **candidate route set**,
- the **route decision state**,
- the **selected route**, if any,
- the **grounds for each live route**,
- the **conditions that would change route ranking**,
- and any **typed downstream publication** already published.

This keeps later handoff reviewable while leaving downstream claims and results under their applicable subject patterns.

For specialization-sensitive routes, the package should also make explicit the declared task family or utility target, the current budget window, the missing discriminator still needed, and the downstream subject pattern that would become applicable if that discriminator and that pattern's other entry conditions are satisfied.

#### B.4.1:4.1 - `RoutedCueSet` shape
A conforming routed cue set may publish:

- `sourceCuePackRef`
- `candidateRouteSet`
- `routeDecision?`
- `selectedRoute?`
- `routeRationale?`
- `routeSelectionStatus?`
- `multiRoutePolicy?`
- `publicationFaceRefs?`
- `articulationThresholdStatus?`
- `closureStatus?`
- `scope?`
- `GammaTime?`

`RoutedCueSet` is not itself the late endpoint. `articulationThresholdStatus` and `closureStatus` report guard state only; their governance remains with `C.2.4` and `C.2.5`, and route discrimination may additionally cite `C.2.6` or `C.2.7` when anchoring or representation-factor differences are load-bearing.

`candidateRouteSet` is the load-bearing core here. `routeDecision`, `selectedRoute`, `routeRationale`, and `routeSelectionStatus` belong here when route selection is explicit. They do **not** belong in `U.PreArticulationCuePack`. The status says only whether plurality remains open or a route has been selected; endpoint admission, publication availability, current use or retirement, and any actual authority relation remain separate claims under A.16 and their direct patterns. Use `sourceCuePackRef` when the originating early form is a cue pack; otherwise identify the equivalent early form and the stabilized cue it preserves.

`publicationFaceRefs` names MVPK faces only when face typing matters for publication or review. Faces are renderings of the routed cue set or of later typed projection publications; they are not the route-bearing form itself.

A multi-route `RoutedCueSet` is still one governed member. A lineage fork requires distinct successor epistemes or project records under their applicable identity and lineage rules. Use `C.2.1` for episteme identity; publication availability remains separate under `E.24.PUB`.

#### B.4.1:4.2 - Starter route family and conditional extension species
The candidate route set may contain, among others:

- starter canonical routes:
  - `EvaluativeRoute`
  - `ActionInvitationRoute`
  - `ProblemAbductionRoute`
  - `MethodWorkRoute`
  - `RequirementCommitmentRoute`
- conditional extension routes for bounded specialization or corridor discovery:
  - `TaskFamilySpecializationRoute`
  - `AdaptationProbeRoute`
  - `NonHumanUtilityRoute`
  - `SubstrateDiversificationRoute`

##### B.4.1:4.2.1 - Specialization-sensitive extension route family
These four routes are not part of the starter canonical core. Use them only when the cue already carries explicit bounded-specialization pressure, corridor-entry pressure, or substrate-fit doubt that subject patterns must be able to recover by value.

Use `TaskFamilySpecializationRoute` when the cue points toward acquiring one narrower higher-fit specialist lane for one declared task family under budget, where that lane may later resolve into one specialist method, portfolio, or competence bundle. Use `AdaptationProbeRoute` when the honest next question is whether threshold-reaching specialization is actually attainable under the current budget. Use `NonHumanUtilityRoute` when the cue suggests a promising utility target outside the current human-default solution corridor but still tied to one declared task family or utility target. Use `SubstrateDiversificationRoute` when the cue says the current method substrate may be too narrow and a broader or different substrate should be tested before commitment.

Contexts may refine the route family locally, but they shall keep the distinction between early route publication and endpoint governance.

#### B.4.1:4.3 - Projection discipline
Here `projection` names route-bounded partialization. The resulting content must be published in a **typed publication form**, rendered, when needed, on an existing MVPK face. The applicable subject pattern governs the downstream claim.

A routed cue set may support these continuations:

- publish `U.AbductivePrompt` under `B.5.2.0`,
- apply `A.6.P`, `A.6.A`, or `C.16.Q` under its own entry conditions and produce the sentence, record, or other result that the selected pattern calls for,
- or publish another explicitly typed upstream projection.

For a proposed downstream projection, if no typed publication form can yet be named honestly, keep the content in `RoutedCueSet`; an MVPK face alone supplies no such form.

### B.4.1:5 - Archetypal Grounding
**Tell.** Observation alone is not yet routing. A route requires at least a stabilized cue plus a declared candidate route set.

**Show (System).** An operator alarm may route toward intervention, rollback, or anomaly investigation without yet becoming work or a requirement.

**Show (Episteme).** An inquiry cue about a model-vs-observation discrepancy may route toward anomaly framing, opportunity framing, or probe design before a hypothesis exists.

### B.4.1:6 - Bias-Annotation
The pattern favors preserving low-articulation cues and publishing route plurality explicitly. The counter-bias is explicit as well: routing must still state why one route is live and why one route was selected if selection occurred.

### B.4.1:7 - Conformance Checklist
- `CC-B.4.1-1` Observe output **SHALL NOT** be forced directly into `AnomalyStatement` when articulation threshold is not yet met.
- `CC-B.4.1-2` A routed cue set **SHALL** name its `candidateRouteSet`.
- `CC-B.4.1-3` When route selection occurs, `routeDecision`, `selectedRoute`, and `routeRationale` **SHALL** be explicit.
- `CC-B.4.1-4` `publicationFaceRefs` **MAY** be named, but route-bearing form and publication face **SHALL NOT** be collapsed.
- `CC-B.4.1-5` `RoutedCueSet` **SHALL NOT** be treated as establishing a late endpoint result.
- `CC-B.4.1-6` When a specialization-sensitive route is kept live, the route package **SHALL** name the declared task family or utility target, the current budget window if known, the missing discriminator still needed, and the downstream subject pattern that would become applicable if the discriminator and that pattern's other entry conditions are satisfied.

### B.4.1:8 - Common Anti-Patterns and How to Avoid Them
- **Anomaly inflation.** Treat every early cue as already an anomaly statement.
- **Cue-pack route smuggling.** Hide route decision or route rationale upstream in `U.PreArticulationCuePack`.
- **False single-route certainty.** Pretend one route is obvious when multiple candidate routes are still live.
- **Projection capture.** Treat a typed downstream projection publication or its MVPK face as if it already governed the endpoint family.

### B.4.1:9 - Consequences
The benefit is an admissible early seam for language-state trajectories and a cleaner bridge from cue preservation to later patterns. The trade-off is one more explicit publication form and one more explicit route declaration.

### B.4.1:10 - Rationale
`B.4.1` provides the route-bearing seam between cue preservation and endpoint or abductive entry. It keeps route publication explicit without forcing cue packs to become route records.

### B.4.1:11 - SoTA-Echoing
This matches practice in incident triage, exploratory design, model probing, and embodied cue work, where routing follows stabilization rather than appearing fully formed at first observation.

### B.4.1:12 - Relations
- Builds on: `B.4`, `C.2.2a`, `A.16`, `A.16.1`, `C.2.LS`.
- Coordinates with: `A.16.0`, `C.2.4`, `C.2.5`, `C.2.6`, `C.2.7`, `B.5.2.0`, `B.5.2`, `A.6.P`, `A.6.A`, `C.16.Q`, `A.15`, `F.9.1`.
- Constrains: pre-abductive route publication.

### B.4.1:13 - Worked Route Sets

#### B.4.1:13.1 - Multi-route operator case
An operator alert note records a service-latency rise after a configuration change and a response-time clause whose applicability to this service is unresolved. The operator may admissibly publish a route set containing:

- `ActionInvitationRoute`,
- `ProblemAbductionRoute`,
- and `RequirementCommitmentRoute`.

Keep the plurality explicit until a selected route is justified. The missing discriminator for `RequirementCommitmentRoute` is whether the clause covers this service and incident window. If it does, use `A.2.8` for the question of an actual duty; the latency cue can still support intervention and explanatory inquiry.

#### B.4.1:13.2 - Inquiry case
A conceptual mismatch may route simultaneously toward:

- explanatory inquiry,
- probe design,
- and later lexical repair.

This is admissible only if the route rationale makes the plurality explicit rather than hiding it under vague prose.

#### B.4.1:13.3 - Invalid direct jump
It is invalid to treat a routed cue set as if it were already a hypothesis, a gate, or a work plan. The route-bearing publication form records candidate continuations; the applicable subject pattern governs the downstream result.

#### B.4.1:13.4 - Specialization-route and nonhuman-utility split
A routed cue set for a new task family may admissibly keep `ProblemAbductionRoute`, `TaskFamilySpecializationRoute`, and `NonHumanUtilityRoute` live together. The point is to preserve the declared task family, utility target, current budget window, missing discriminator, and possible corridor-entry load without laundering those routes into a premature prompt, selector, or policy choice.

### B.4.1:14 - Keeping route plurality useful

A routed cue set stays useful only when route plurality, route grounds, selection status, and any current-use or retirement claim remain explicit.

#### B.4.1:14.1 - Minimal route package
Use the minimal route package in §4 (Solution).

#### B.4.1:14.2 - Selected route is not endpoint governance
Even when one route is selected, the routed cue set remains a seam publication form. Apply a downstream subject pattern when its entry conditions are met; that pattern governs the next claim or result.

#### B.4.1:14.3 - Review prompt and threshold reminder
A reviewer should check whether the selected route is justified by the published cue pack or equivalent early form and whether suppressed alternative routes were genuinely considered rather than silently erased. If the articulation threshold required for a proposed late prompt, requirement, or work claim is not yet met, keep the publication early.

#### B.4.1:14.4 - Deferred selection and route splitting
Deferral is admissible when route plurality and missing discriminators are published. It is not admissible when one route is silently assumed while the publication still speaks as if the question were open.

One cue cluster may also split into several routed cue sets if different sub-cues support different destinations. The split should be published explicitly so that later readers do not assume that one route exhausted the whole original cue complex.

### B.4.1:15 - Migration and worked continuation boundaries

`B.4.1` governs route publication. Use the applicable subject patterns for abductive reasoning, lexical repair, deontic commitment, and work execution when their entry conditions are met.

#### B.4.1:15.1 - Migration from anomaly-first prose
Older anomaly-first language should be migrated into route publication when the publication does not yet meet anomaly-governance entry conditions.

#### B.4.1:15.2 - Intervention vs inquiry split
An operator-facing disturbance may legitimately support both:

- an immediate intervention-oriented route,
- and a slower explanatory route.

`B.4.1` preserves both continuations with their own grounds and selection conditions.

#### B.4.1:15.3 - Requirement-route overreach
A route set that includes `RequirementCommitmentRoute` should not be read as if the requirement already exists. The route is one admissible continuation; the requirement or commitment claim is decided under its own subject pattern.

#### B.4.1:15.4 - Leaving the seam
Continue under a later subject pattern when its own entry conditions are met. Typical questions and entry requirements are:

- relation-bearing wording whose direct relation, participants, direction, or required detail remain unresolved: `A.6.P`;
- evaluative wording with enough articulation to name the bearer, effective scheme, probe/model frame, comparison frame or `none`, ClaimScope, and at least one candidate evaluative family: `C.16.Q`;
- action-invitation wording with enough `AE` to name site, enactor, and action structure, and enough `CD` for one invitation interpretation to be worth publishing: `A.6.A`;
- a declared prompt species, stable open question, scope, and provenance, with the articulation and closure conditions for rival answers to remain live: `B.5.2.0`;
- an explicit requirement or commitment claim over its actual subject: its requirement-facing pattern; use `A.2.8` for a question about an actual individual duty;
- or an alignment question involving Method, intended WorkPlan, or actual Work: `A.15`; use `A.3.1`, `A.15.2`, or `A.15.1` directly when only the Method, WorkPlan, or dated Work is in question.

If those next-use entry conditions cannot yet be established, keep the governed publication in this seam with its route plurality visible.

### B.4.1:20 - Route Evidence and Discrimination Package

#### B.4.1:20.1 - Evidence-per-route rule
Each live route in a routed cue set should cite the cue grounds that actually support it. Where those grounds are not yet published, complete the route account so readers can assess the support.

#### B.4.1:20.2 - Discriminator publication
When a route set remains plural, authors should name the discriminator they are waiting for: a missing anchor, contrast, measurement, witness, articulation threshold, closure condition, or other explicit facet transition. This tells later readers which fact or facet change would justify reconsidering the route set.

#### B.4.1:20.3 - Multi-route state is not yet a lineage fork
One routed cue set may keep several candidate routes live without yet forking lineage. A fork occurs only when distinct successor epistemes or project records are identified under their own identity rules and their preserved and lost content and any exact lineage relations that obtain are stated. Publication availability and any responsibility or authority handoff remain separate claims.

#### B.4.1:20.4 - Projection restraint
A typed downstream projection publication or prompt may be shown as one admissible continuation; the other live routes and their grounds and discriminators shall remain readable.

#### B.4.1:20.5 - Review test for false single-route certainty
Ask: if the selected route were denied, would the publication still contain enough information to explain the other live routes and the discriminator that would separate them? If not, the route set is under-published and has collapsed too early into one favored continuation.
