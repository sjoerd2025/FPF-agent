## C.32.ACE - Architecture Characteristic Eval Programs

> **Type:** Architecture eval-support subpattern under C.32
> **Status:** Stable
> **Normativity:** Normative unless explicitly marked informative

### C.32.ACE:1 - Problem frame

Use this pattern when an architecture team already has project architecture-characteristic rows and must evaluate the current architecture, compare candidate architectures, monitor evolution, or prepare a selection input.

Primary working reader: an architect or evaluator preparing readings over declared architecture-characteristic criteria without turning those readings into the criteria or the decision.

Typical entry phrases:

```text
"We have criteria rows; which eval reading shows how candidate A and candidate B compare under the same parity frame?"
"The monitor is useful, but is this a reading, a test failure, or a decision input?"
"Two methods, roles, system variants, or AI workflows need fair comparison against the same architecture characteristics."
```

**First-minute use slice.** A product-family team has ACS rows for substitutability, evidence reuse, and latency, plus safety as a monitored guardrail. Two candidate architectures look plausible. The practitioner writes one ACE program record with the same claim scope, selected context slices, reference scheme and plane, evaluation window, parity frame, and input projections for both candidates. `EvalService-7` first has the A.13 core for candidate evaluation, and A.15.1 independently admits `CandidateEvalWork-42`, which enacts `ArchitectureCandidateEvaluationMethod-7` and occurs within `ProductFamilyEvaluationService-7`. This first-minute record expressly represents evaluator accountability under `EvaluatorAssignment-3`, an obtaining occurrence of directly declared species `EvaluatorAssignment`, so it also includes the separate F.6 relation through the same A.13 assignment. A Work-only ACE record would omit those assignment and attribution refs, and failed F.6 would leave `CandidateEvalWork-42` intact. `CandidateLatencyReading-42` and `CandidateEvidenceScopeFinding-42` are typed results established through their result patterns. Those results can become inputs for `A.19.CPM` comparison or the next C.32 synthesis pass; neither the program record, Work, nor a result defines the criterion or decides the architecture.

This pattern concerns one architecture-characteristic eval-program record over declared criteria rows, Q-Bundle slots, candidates, bearers, or selected structures under a parity frame. It is a record in a C.32.ACE-local form, not a new `U.*` kind and not, by its `program` label, a `U.Method`, `U.MethodDescription`, `U.WorkPlan`, dated `U.Work`, or evaluation result. When measurement validity, comparison policy, a selection result, G.5 result declaration, publication, or architecture decision is current, use the definition and test for that claim.

Ordinary working move: choose the declared criteria rows, bind the claim scope, relevant context slices, reference scheme and plane, evaluation window, and input projections, and hold one parity frame for all variants. When evaluation actually occurs, recover each exact evaluator through A.13 and let A.15.1 independently admit the `U.Work` occurrence. Add `evaluationWorkAttributionRefs` only when the program or receiving use expressly represents precise assignment-bound attribution; missing or failed F.6 leaves the Work intact. Any A.6.1 operation application is an additional relation, not a substitute for the Method enacted by the Work. Return the typed results established through their result patterns as feedback for comparison or the next synthesis pass.

The first useful output is an `ArchitectureCharacteristicEvalProgram@Project`. This C.32.ACE-local working record states how one bounded architecture evaluation is to be framed over declared criteria. When a reusable way of evaluating is current, identify that separate `U.Method` under A.3.1; when a claim-bearing episteme describes that exact Method, test the same episteme for `U.MethodDescription` under A.3.2. A planned evaluation belongs to A.15.2, an actual dated evaluation to A.15.1, and each result to its direct measurement, comparison, evaluation, or assertion pattern. Use the record to frame readings of characteristics through rows, slots, candidates, or structures; it is not any of those neighboring objects.

For a first pass, fill the exact claim scope and selected context slices, reference scheme and plane, evaluation window and input projections, evaluated rows or Q-Bundle slots, evaluated candidates or structures, parity frame, eval purpose, intended eval operation, result form, receiving use, and refresh or retire condition. Add project-use refs only for a claimed project-local program; add Method, MethodDescription, actual evaluation Work, operation-application, and typed-result refs only when those separate objects are current.

Here `@Project` is a compatibility and retrieval cue only. It supplies no project entity, composite-work identity, context, authority, viewpoint, or parthood. A program local to one actual project names both the composite `U.Work` in `projectWorkOccurrenceRef` and the obtaining program-use relation in `architectureEvalProgramProjectUseRelationRef`; either field alone is insufficient. `evalOperation` states the intended operation family in the program record, not an actual run or application. Each `evaluationWorkRef` names one independently identified `U.Work` occurrence whose exact actual performers have A.13 cores and which A.15.1 admits independently. `evaluationWorkAttributionRefs` are optional and appear only when the record or receiving use expressly represents precise assignment-bound attribution; any present ref resolves through F.6 to the same obtaining A.13 assignment, and its absence or failure does not invalidate the Work ref. Any A.6.1 application binding and each typed result remain under the applicable patterns. A program, Method, MethodDescription, Work occurrence, operation application, assignment, attribution, and result never substitute for one another.

What goes wrong if C.32.ACE is missed: a project has architecture-characteristic rows but treats a test, monitor, dashboard, or source-side "fitness function" as the criterion or as the decision. The team may then reject useful losing variants as errors, optimize one indicator, or choose a candidate without fair comparison.

What C.32.ACE buys in practice: eval work is framed as typed evaluation over declared architecture criteria. A losing candidate can still add knowledge about the solution space, while an actual error remains a failure against an expectation that causes unplanned rework.

Adoption test: after using C.32.ACE, the record shows the candidates, bearers, or selected structures to be evaluated under the same parity frame, the declared result form, and which pattern for the next question may use the reading as feedback. When an actual result is claimed, the record cites that separately established result and its result form.

Not this pattern when the characteristic rows do not exist yet. Also not this pattern when the current work is measurement validity, composite-quality modeling, explicit comparison, set-returning selection, local choice, selected-set result declaration, actual publication, evidence, assurance, or project architecture decision.

Common exits by claim kind:

- `C.32.HCS` and `C.32.ACS` before characteristic rows exist.
- `C.16` for measurement validity, readings, units, uncertainty, or comparability claims.
- `C.25` for Q-Bundles and composite quality families.
- `E.13` when an eval result or dashboard starts replacing the declared architecture concern.
- `C.32` for candidate synthesis, `C.32.MLAO` for residual input, and `E.23` for repeated improvement feedback.
- `A.19.CPM` for explicit comparison, `A.19.SelectorMechanism` for set-returning selection, `C.11` for local choice, and `G.5` for selected-set result declaration. For publication, use `E.17` for a source-backed face and source return and `E.24.PUB` for the publication occurrence and audience availability.
- `A.10` and `B.3` when evidence or assurance claims are being made.
- `C.32.PAD` for project decision.

### C.32.ACE:2 - Problem

Architecture synthesis is an optimization and learning activity under competing characteristics. It needs evals: deliberate measurement, simulation, benchmark, scenario, review, or monitoring runs that say how a current architecture or candidate architecture reads against declared criteria.

Testing for errors is a neighboring use. A test asks whether an expectation is violated. An eval asks how variants compare, how a candidate changes the trade-off front, which constraint is hit, or whether the next synthesis pass should open. A candidate that loses the eval is not automatically an error; it may be a deliberate probe that improves the architecture team's knowledge of the solution space.

Evolutionary-architecture sources often say "fitness function". In FPF that is source-side wording. The recoverable FPF object is an eval program over declared architecture-characteristic rows, Q-Bundle slots, candidate structures, and a parity frame. Some eval programs can specify automated tests or monitors, but automation does not change the kind of the program record.

### C.32.ACE:3 - Forces

| Force | Tension |
|---|---|
| Variant learning | Candidate architectures may be valuable even when they lose the selection being made. |
| Fair comparison | Eval results are useful only when context, budgets, windows, units (when required by the scale), and missing-data treatment are explicit. |
| Trade-off pressure | Improving one architecture characteristic can worsen another. |
| Automation value | Frequent automated evals reveal drift early, but their results can be overread. |
| Error prevention | Some eval operations are tests, yet error checking must not replace variant comparison. |
| Evolution | A useful eval can expire when the source-currentness relation, environment, declared holon-level ref, or scale window changes. |

### C.32.ACE:4 - Solution

Create an architecture-characteristic eval program only after the evaluated criteria rows exist in `C.32.ACS` or a declared C.25 Q-Bundle slot.

Work in this order:

1. Reference the evaluated ACS criteria set, evaluated rows, and any Q-Bundle slots.
2. State the eval purpose: current characterization, candidate comparison, portfolio-frontier work, post-change impact measurement, monitoring, or trigger for the next synthesis pass.
3. Name the candidates, bearers, and selected structures being evaluated.
4. Establish one exact `U.ClaimScope`, the relevant A.2.6 `U.ContextSlice` membership, effective `U.ReferenceScheme` and reference plane, evaluation window, input projections, resource budget, units (when required by the scale), admissible observation or evidence inputs, and missing-or-unknown policy. Record their parity requirement in `parityFrameRef`; the parity-frame record does not replace those bindings.
5. Choose eval scope: one criterion, coupled criteria, one Q-Bundle slice, a candidate portfolio, or a holistic use slice.
6. Choose eval operations. Use measurement, simulation, benchmark, scenario walkthrough, monitor, review, or evidence audit according to the claim. Use `test` only when the intended operation checks an expectation or hard constraint. When evaluation actually occurs, recover each exact evaluator through A.13 and let A.15.1 independently admit the `U.Work` occurrence and enacted Method. Add `evaluationWorkAttributionRefs` only when the record or receiving use expressly represents precise assignment-bound attribution. Independently identify the relation or A.6.1 application binding that obtains and the typed result; the program record itself does not run.
7. Declare the result form. Examples include a reading, band, rank, dominance relation, trade-off front, qualitative state, or evidence finding; use the definition and test for the actual result kind.
8. Name proxy risk and protected counter-characteristics before the eval result can drive work. Optimize only the cycle's chosen indicators; keep the remaining protected characteristics visible as guardrails or risk signals.
9. State the receiving use: `C.32` synthesis input, `C.32.MLAO` residual input, `E.23` improvement feedback, `A.19.CPM` comparison input, `A.19.SelectorMechanism` selection input, `C.11` choice input, input for a selected-set result declared under `G.5`, or architecture-decision input for `C.32.PAD`. For publication input, distinguish `E.17` source-backed face and source return from the `E.24.PUB` publication occurrence and audience availability.
10. Refresh or retire the eval program when the evaluated row, C.32 candidate palette, bearer, selected structure, environment, parity frame, or source-currentness relation changes.

**Stop condition.** Stop C.32.ACE when the eval program names evaluated rows or Q-Bundle slots, evaluated candidates or structures, parity frame, eval purpose, eval operation, result form, receiving use, proxy risk, protected counter-characteristics, and refresh or retire condition.

**Lowering condition.** Use the eval result for the current architecture work only while the evaluated rows, evaluated candidates or structures, parity frame, eval operation, result form, and receiving use still match the work being done. Limit use of the result to report-only when missing data, proxy risk, or parity-frame mismatch prevents the intended synthesis, comparison, selection, selected-set result declaration, actual publication, choice, evidence, assurance, or decision use. Retire the eval program when its evaluated row, bearer, selected structure, environment, source-currentness relation, or receiving use no longer belongs to the current architecture work. Use `C.32.ACS` when the criteria row is missing or wrong, `C.16` when measurement validity is current, `C.25` when the evaluated item is composite, and the named pattern for the next question when a stronger downstream claim is current.

### C.32.ACE:5 - Worked slices

**Latency candidate.** A service candidate promises latency under 100 ms and an eval reads 240 ms. If the 100 ms band is a hard constraint, the candidate is inadmissible for this cycle. If the project is still exploring a trade-off front, the candidate misses the latency target while supplying useful evidence about resource placement, interface burden, or control separation. Treat it as an error only when the project used that expectation to plan work and unplanned rework follows.

**BIM digital twin.** A built-asset team compares architecture candidates that combine placement, schedule, use-phase, maintenance, and cost structures. ACE does not treat the number of dimensions as the evaluation. The practitioner defines a parity frame and evals the ACS rows declared for the project, such as access, source-return cost, observability, and maintenance reach, then records results with the parity-frame and result-form fields needed by `A.19.CPM`.

**Method-family architecture.** A review-Method family has ACS rows for evidence reuse and change reach. If source wording also says “role substitutability,” use `E.10.ROLE` and `C.32.ACS` to bind the exact recovered subject and predicate—such as substitutability among local system-role kinds under A.2.7, not among holders or assignments—before ACE evaluates it. A separate C.25 bundle covers teachability. ACE defines a batch evaluation over three Method variants. One variant loses on teachability but reveals a reusable evidence relation; C.32 may use it as a stepping stone.

**AI-agent workflow.** A model-supported workflow has candidates with different function graphs and tool boundaries. ACE evaluates latency, evidence refresh, policy controllability, and rollback under the same task set and evidence window. A benchmark score is not the architecture decision; it supplies one eval reading inside the parity frame.

**Hospital escalation.** A hospital escalation team has ACS rows for decision latency, accountability clarity, and evidence custody. Any source “role continuity” or “role-boundary” criterion first goes through `E.10.ROLE` and `C.32.ACS`, which binds the exact subject and predicate—such as continuity of assignment occurrences and their holder Systems, or a boundary among exact participant relations. ACE evaluates two recovered architecture variants under the same incident scenarios and handoff evidence window. The result can feed comparison or the next synthesis pass; staffing choice remains with the receiving decision pattern.

### C.32.ACE:6 - Kind and Receiving-Claim Boundary

Use C.32.ACE to construct the local architecture-characteristic eval-program record and to keep criterion, reusable evaluation Method, MethodDescription episteme, intended operation family, planned evaluation, actual dated evaluation Work, actual operation application, typed result, comparison input, selection input, and decision input distinct. The local record admits no new U-kind. Use A.3.1, A.3.2, A.15.2, A.15.1, and A.6.1 for their respective objects and relations; use the pattern that defines and tests each actual result. C.32.ACE does not define starter characteristic selection, ACS scale-row construction, measurement validity, Q-Bundle normal form, candidate synthesis, comparison policy, final selection, local choice, G.5 selected-set result declaration, publication, or an architecture decision. When those claims are current, use `C.32.HCS`, `C.32.ACS`, `C.16`, `C.25`, `C.32`, `A.19.CPM`, `A.19.SelectorMechanism`, `C.11`, `G.5`, or `C.32.PAD` as applicable. For publication, use `E.17` for a source-backed publication face and return to source and `E.24.PUB` for the publication occurrence, form, carrier, audience, bounded use, and availability.

### C.32.ACE:7 - Conformance requirements

| Requirement | Required result |
|---|---|
| `CC-ACE-1` | Every eval references declared ACS rows or C.25 Q-Bundle slots. |
| `CC-ACE-2` | Every eval names evaluated candidates, bearers, or selected structures. |
| `CC-ACE-3` | Purpose, parity frame, scope, eval operation, trigger mode, result form, and run context are explicit. |
| `CC-ACE-4` | Measurement claims require `C.16`; composite quality claims require `C.25`. |
| `CC-ACE-5` | Proxy risk, missing-data policy, and protected counter-characteristics are named before a receiving synthesis, comparison, or selection pattern uses the eval result. |
| `CC-ACE-6` | Source-side "fitness function" wording is not used as the FPF object name in the record. |
| `CC-ACE-7` | A check or test is admitted only as one eval operation when an expectation or hard constraint is being inspected. |
| `CC-ACE-8` | The eval result does not select, decide, certify, or carry an architecture-adequacy claim by itself. |
| `CC-ACE-9` | A project-local program names both `projectWorkOccurrenceRef` and `architectureEvalProgramProjectUseRelationRef`; the suffix or either reference alone asserts no locality. |
| `CC-ACE-10` | The record separately identifies any reusable Method, MethodDescription, planned evaluation, dated evaluation Work, actual operation application, and typed result that the use needs; `evalOperation` or `resultForm` supplies none of those occurrences or identities. |
| `CC-ACE-11` | Every actual evaluation use binds one exact `U.ClaimScope`, relevant A.2.6 `U.ContextSlice` membership, effective reference scheme and plane, evaluation window, and input projections; `evalScope`, `runContext`, and `parityFrameRef` do not replace them. |

### C.32.ACE:8 - Common failures and repairs

| Failure | Symptom | Repair |
|---|---|---|
| `SourceFitnessTermAsFPFObject` | "Fitness function" is written as the object under work. | Rewrite as `ArchitectureCharacteristicEvalProgram@Project` and name evaluated rows, candidates, parity frame, eval operations, and receiving use. |
| `EvalAsCriterion` | A benchmark, monitor, or test is named as the architecture characteristic. | Return to ACS; name the criterion, bearer, scale, proxy risk, and protected counter-characteristics before writing the eval. |
| `TestModeAsEvalWhole` | The team only asks whether one candidate passes while the work question is variant comparison. | Keep the test for the hard constraint, then add eval result forms that compare candidates or expose the trade-off front. |
| `UnfairComparison` | Candidates are compared under different budgets, evidence windows, environments, or missing-data rules. | Rebuild the parity frame or record the result as unusable for selection. |
| `ResultAsDecision` | A rank, score, pass, or dashboard reading selects the architecture. | Treat the result as source material for an A.10 evidence-provenance account when an evidence claim is current, or as comparison input when comparison is current. Use `A.19.CPM` for explicit comparison, `A.19.SelectorMechanism` for set-returning selection, `C.11` for local choice, `G.5` for selected-set result declaration, and `C.32.PAD` for a project architecture decision. For publication, use `E.17` for a source-backed face and source return and `E.24.PUB` for the publication occurrence and audience availability. |
| `SingleIndicatorGoodhart` | Work improves one optimized indicator while an unmeasured architecture concern worsens. | Limit optimized indicators, add protected counter-characteristics, and open `E.13` when proxy-to-value drift appears. |
| `LosingVariantAsError` | A candidate that lost a planned eval is recorded as a mistake. | Record it as a variant result unless an expectation caused unplanned rework; keep useful learning in the variant archive. |
| `ProgramAsRunOrResult` | The ACE record is said to execute, measure, evaluate, or produce the result, or one generic `resultRef` hides the result kind. | Recover each exact evaluator through A.13 and let A.15.1 independently admit the evaluation `U.Work`. Add an attribution ref only when the record expressly represents precise assignment-bound attribution; missing or failed F.6 leaves the Work intact. Add an operation application only when it independently obtains, and identify the typed result under the applicable pattern; keep the ACE record as the evaluation framing record. |

### C.32.ACE:9 - Consequences

| Consequence | Benefit | Cost |
|---|---|---|
| Evals are typed evaluations over declared criteria. | Variant comparison can proceed without collapsing criteria, readings, and decisions. | The team must write the parity frame before using the result in a pattern for the next question. |
| Expectation-failure tests remain one eval operation when their expectation is declared. | Error prevention remains available without replacing optimization. | Some pass-fail dashboards can no longer drive decisions by themselves. |
| Losing variants remain useful. | Architecture exploration keeps stepping stones and source-space learning. | The variant archive needs deliberate upkeep. |
| Proxy and counter-characteristic risks are explicit. | Goodhart pressure is visible before eval results drive work. | More rows may remain monitored as guardrails rather than optimized. |

### C.32.ACE:10 - Rationale

An architecture-characteristic eval program is the missing middle object between criteria rows and architecture selection. It frames the question "how did these candidates or structures read under this parity frame?"; the answer comes from independently established typed results. It does not answer "what is the criterion?", "is the measurement valid outside this use?", or "which architecture must be chosen?"

The pattern is architecture-specific because it evaluates selected structures and architecture characteristics. The same eval form can be used in system, organization-as-system, built-asset, episteme, work-occurrence, discipline, AI-agent-setup, and C.36-recovered cultural-evolution cases once the admitted holon being described has been identified in each case. It can also evaluate Method-side, Work-side, evidence-side, local-kind, classification, or assignment structures after the described holon, the defining or constraining ClaimGraph located through the subject pattern, the bearer and predicate, and the scale rows are rebound. Unresolved “role” wording goes through `E.10.ROLE`; the pattern does not admit Methods, roles, practices, or cultures as holon kinds by label.

### C.32.ACE:11 - SoTA-Echoing

These rows document how source practice contributes to eval-program fields, result-use boundaries, and refresh conditions in C.32.ACE.

| Source to inspect | Why this source is load-bearing here | Transfer into ACE | Concrete ACE mutation | Blocked overread |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| FPF source presentation `ТриПрототипаТриОшибки` (2022-03-26) | Separates variant, prototype, candidate, stake, solution, error, eval as variant comparison, and testing as error checking; also requires fair comparison and indicator selection. | Make eval a typed architecture evaluation over declared candidates and criteria. | `test` is admitted only as one `evalOperation` when expectation failure or hard-constraint checking is current; parity frame and result form are mandatory. | A test, check, or pass-fail result is not the whole eval program, not the criterion, and not the decision. |
| Ford, Parsons, Kua, and Sadalage, `Building Evolutionary Architectures`, 2nd ed. (`https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/building-evolutionary-architectures/9781492097532/`) | Current practitioner source for incremental architecture governance and feedback under source-side fitness-function terminology. | Restore the source term to FPF eval programs over ACS rows, Q-Bundle slots, candidate structures, and parity frames. | ACE record names evaluated rows, purpose, scope, eval operation, trigger mode, result form, run context, receiving use, and refresh or retire condition. | Fitness-function wording is not imported as the FPF object name or as a new architecture characteristic kind. |
| `Software Architecture Metrics` (`https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/software-architecture-metrics/9781098112226/`) | Current practitioner source for metric categories and governance practice after quality goals are named. | Carry metric-cadence distinctions as eval-program fields, not as criteria rows. | ACE distinguishes scope, trigger mode, result form, run context, method refs, and refresh or retire condition. | A metric, dashboard, rank, or score is not a project criterion, selected architecture, or architecture decision. |
| Ford, Richards, Sadalage, and Dehghani, `Software Architecture: The Hard Parts` (`https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/software-architecture-the/9781492086888/`) | Mature practitioner source for objective definitions, trade-off analysis, and least-worst choices under competing characteristics. | Require declared criteria rows and protected counter-characteristics before synthesis, comparison, or selection uses eval results. | ACE rows carry proxy risk, protected counter-characteristics, and receiving use before result-driven action. | A better reading or rank does not authorize comparison, selection, choice, G.5 selected-set result declaration, actual publication, or decision by itself. |
| Goodhart and proxy-risk line, plus current FPF `E.13` | Optimized proxies can detach from the declared architecture concern. | Keep proxy repair in E.13 while ACE records the risk before result use. | ACE requires proxy risk and protected counter-characteristics; proxy drift requires `E.13`. | An eval result cannot replace the declared architecture concern. |
| Current FPF `C.16`, `C.25`, `E.23`, `A.19.CPM`, `A.19.SelectorMechanism`, `G.5`, `E.17`, `E.24.PUB`, and `C.11` | Existing patterns for the next questions for measurement, Q-Bundles, repeated improvement, comparison, selection, selected-set result declaration, publication, and local choice. | Keep ACE as the eval-program framing and typed-result dispatch boundary. | Use C.16 for measurement validity and readings, C.25 for composite quality, E.23 for improvement feedback, A.19.CPM for comparison, A.19.SelectorMechanism for set-returning selection, G.5 for selected-set result declaration, E.17 for a source-backed publication face and return to source, E.24.PUB for an actual publication occurrence and availability, and C.11 for local choice. Accept each actual typed result only under the definition and test for that result. | ACE does not validate measurement, define every eval result, define Q-Bundles, compare, select, declare a selected-set result under G.5, publish it to an audience, choose, or decide. |

**Source-currentness boundary.** Use each source row only for the ACE eval-program field, result-use boundary, or refresh condition named in that row. Recheck the row when a named book edition, source presentation, FPF pattern for the next question, metric practice, or evolutionary-architecture practice changes the transferred move. If the project wants criteria-row admission, measurement validity, Q-Bundle structure, explicit comparison, selection, selected-set result declaration, actual publication, local choice, evidence, assurance, or decision use, leave ACE and open the pattern for the next question.

### C.32.ACE:12 - Relations

- **Builds on:** `C.32.HCS`, `C.32.ACS`, `C.16`, `C.16.P`, `C.25`, `A.2.6`, `A.19`, `E.13`, `E.22`, `E.23`, and `A.19.CPM`; coordinates with A.3.1, A.3.2, A.15.2, A.15.1, and A.6.1 only for separately current Method, MethodDescription, planned Work, dated Work, or operation-application claims.
- **Receiving uses:** `C.32.P2S` actual-structure feedback and next-synthesis repair, `C.32` candidate synthesis, `C.32.MLAO` residual optimization, `C.32.CONWAY` correspondence frames, `C.32.FAIL` repair, `A.19.CPM` comparison, `A.19.SelectorMechanism` selection, `C.11` local choice, selected-set result declaration under `G.5`, source-backed publication-face and source-return work under `E.17`, publication-occurrence and audience-availability work under `E.24.PUB`, and architecture-decision work for `C.32.PAD`.
- **Measurement boundary:** Use `C.16` when a reading, coordinate, unit, threshold, score, uncertainty, or cross-case comparability claim is made.
- **Structural-information boundary:** For an eval, these contributions are available only after `C.32.ACS`, `C.16`, or `C.25` has declared what is being evaluated: `C.33` and `C.34` for captured structure, lost structure, and preservation adequacy, and `C.35` for recovering the kind of a generated or discovered result and assessing its adequacy for that architecture use. Use C.32.ACE for the eval-program frame, and accept each actual typed result under its own measurement, comparison, evaluation, or assertion definition and test. `C.33`, `C.34`, and `C.35` do not define eval programs.
- **Q-Bundle boundary:** Use `C.25` when the evaluated item is a composite quality family.
- **Test boundary:** Use `test` only as an eval operation for a declared expectation or hard constraint. Error recognition and architecture-synthesis repair use `C.32.FAIL`; non-architecture defects use the local defect-subject pattern.
- **Decision boundary:** An evaluation framed by an ACE record may reference separately admitted readings, ranks, dominance relations, trade-off-front descriptions, and other typed results. When such a result is current, identify the admitted System, dated evaluation Work, applicable operation application, and the definition and test used for that exact measurement, comparison, evaluation, or assertion result. Such a result may serve as source material for an A.10 evidence-provenance account when an evidence claim is current. Use `A.19.CPM` for explicit comparison, `A.19.SelectorMechanism` for set-returning selection, `C.11` for local choice, `G.5` for selected-set result declaration, and `C.32.PAD` for a project architecture decision. When audience availability is current, use `E.17` for a source-backed publication face and return to source and `E.24.PUB` for the publication occurrence, form, carrier, audience, bounded use, and availability.

### C.32.ACE:13 - Footer marker

C.32.ACE closes when the eval program names evaluated criteria, evaluated candidates or structures, exact claim scope and selected context slices, effective reference scheme and plane, evaluation window and input projections, parity frame, eval purpose, scope, intended eval operation, trigger mode, result form, method refs, proxy risks, protected counter-characteristics, receiving use, and refresh or retire condition. When actual evaluation is claimed, each exact evaluator has its A.13 core and `evaluationWorkRefs` name independently admitted A.15.1 Work. Optional `evaluationWorkAttributionRefs` appear only when the record or receiving use expressly represents precise assignment-bound attribution. Any separately obtaining operation application and typed result remain independently identified.
