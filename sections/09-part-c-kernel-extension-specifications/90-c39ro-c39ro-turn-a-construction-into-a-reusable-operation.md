## C.39.RO - Turn a Construction into a Reusable Operation

> **Type:** Method pattern
> **Status:** Draft
> **Normativity:** Normative

### C.39.RO:1 - Problem frame

Use this pattern when a worked way of obtaining a result should become available for changed inputs, another case or combination with other operations, and its reusable part is still unclear. A correction works for three timing markers but its numbers have been copied into the next recording. A partition has been found for one set of conflicts, while the next project has different participants. A physical action succeeds once, while the conditions for repeating it remain implicit.

The subject is the obtaining operation being developed: what it takes, what it does, what it returns and the conditions under which that result follows. Start from a construction whose useful steps can be recovered. B.5.RC and B.5.RA help when those steps or their reasons are missing.

**First useful move.** Choose one foreseeable change of input. Identify which values belonged to the earlier case and which relations made its construction work. For a timing correction, the particular offsets can change while the operation remains “center the smallest and largest offsets.”

The result is an operation that another use can instantiate, together with its meaningful inputs, result and application conditions. A formula, procedure, diagram or demonstrated action can express the needed contribution. Select the expression that the receiving practitioner can use.

Use an existing adequate operation directly. Develop only the part whose reuse is missing. When the question is what happened in several observed performances, A.3.1.MR supplies Method recovery. When a formal U.Method or MethodDescription claim is needed, A.3.1 and A.3.2 govern that claim after the obtaining operation has been made clear.

### C.39.RO:2 - Problem

A successful case mixes reusable relations with its particular values, available resources and incidental choices. Copying the whole case can fail when any of those particulars changes. Replacing all its nouns with variables can fail as well: the result may have depended on a fixed geometry, an allowed operation or a physical condition that the generalized description has erased.

The practitioner needs to expose what another use may vary while retaining how the result is obtained. This work can also reveal a useful limit: the generalized operation may return an obstruction or an unattainable tolerance for some inputs.

### C.39.RO:3 - Forces

| Force | Tension |
| --- | --- |
| Reuse | A useful operation should accommodate the intended variations while retaining the conditions that made the construction work. |
| Construction cost | Exposing one needed reusable step can be worthwhile when building a whole library would add little to the receiving use. |
| Explanation | A short expression is easy to carry, but the next practitioner needs the meaning of its inputs and result. |
| Justification | A derived conditional result and an empirical expectation support different uses and further inquiries. |
| Composition | An output can feed another operation only when its meaning and conditions meet that operation's input needs. |
| Development | A changed case can improve the operation or expose a new question, while unaffected uses remain available. |

### C.39.RO:4 - Solution

Recover the working construction, choose the intended variation, expose an operation under retained conditions, and examine what it returns in a changed use.

**Recover the case → choose what may vary → construct the operation → justify its result → examine a changed use → retain, narrow or develop it.**

#### C.39.RO:4.1 - Recover the useful construction

Follow how the existing case obtained its result. Identify the material or values used, the operations performed, their dependencies and the reason the result answered the question.

Select a receiving use that needs more than the original answer. It may need the same transformation on another input, an intermediate result for another operation, or a way to adjust the construction. If the original result itself suffices, use it and stop.

A trace can reveal that the apparent reusable step depended on an unreported contribution. Recover that contribution through B.5.RC or the relevant subject Method before building on it.

#### C.39.RO:4.2 - Separate case values from application conditions

Choose which parts should vary in the receiving use. Give each variable part a meaning, such as a finite set of offsets in milliseconds, a collection of activities or a requested volume. Retain the relations among them.

Identify the conditions that stay in force: a common time reference, symmetric pairwise conflicts, an allowed constant correction, or a physical rate over the relevant interval. A case value becomes a parameter only when the proposed operation explains how it uses different admissible values.

Examine a simple boundary of the proposed input. A procedure that takes a minimum and maximum needs a nonempty set. A partition procedure needs the conflict relation that it actually handles. State a useful failure result when an input can be understood but the requested outcome is impossible.

#### C.39.RO:4.3 - Construct the reusable operation

Replace case-specific choices with operations on the selected inputs. Preserve their order and dependencies wherever changing them would change the result.

Three common constructions can help:

- **Parameterize a choice.** Replace “subtract 42.5 milliseconds” with “subtract the midpoint of the smallest and largest observed offsets.”
- **Compose available operations.** Convert the receiving data into a form an existing operation accepts, perform that operation, and interpret its result for the receiving use. Check the intermediate meaning at each connection.
- **Replace a constituent operation.** When the intended variation invalidates one step, find a substitute that supplies the result its successor needs. Retain the other steps whose conditions still hold.

Use the subject practice to construct a genuinely missing constituent. C.39 helps find such a way; B.5.TU helps make an available theory operative. If the desired result is still unsupported, name the unresolved step and the smaller result already obtainable.

#### C.39.RO:4.4 - Explain what the operation supports

Recover the reason for the output over the proposed input range.

For a deductive construction, follow the argument with the case values left variable. State the premises used and inspect the branches, exceptional inputs and termination conditions that matter. A short bound can establish both an operation's result and its optimality for a stated criterion, as in :5.1.

For an operation proposed from observations, identify the observed support and the conditions under which repeatability is expected. Use an available subject model when it supplies that connection. A changed physical setting may leave the mathematical operation intact while invalidating its application to the setup.

Keep the conclusion at that supported scope. Choose further proof, model development or observation when the receiving use needs it and the obtainable contribution warrants its cost.

#### C.39.RO:4.5 - Examine a changed use

Instantiate the operation on the selected changed input. Perform its steps and interpret the output. Choose a change that exercises what was generalized: more inputs, a different arrangement, a boundary condition or a changed constituent.

Compare the obtained result with the receiving question. If the operation returns a failure witness, use it to change the proposed action or question. If an assumption fails, repair the dependent part or narrow the application conditions.

A worked changed case can expose a defect in the proposed operation. The scope of a general conclusion still comes from its argument or empirical basis. B.5.RR supplies local revision of that reasoning; B.5.QD develops a new question when the result calls for one.

#### C.39.RO:4.6 - Make the operation usable at the receiving point

Give the next practitioner the input meanings, the operation, its result and the conditions needed for that use. Keep the reason or worked construction accessible where adaptation will depend on it. A concise name helps retrieval when it reflects what the operation does.

Stop when the receiving use can instantiate the operation or understand its supported limit.

### C.39.RO:5 - Archetypal Grounding

#### C.39.RO:5.1 - Generalize a timing correction and obtain an impossibility result

A recording has picture-to-sound offsets of 40, 42 and 45 milliseconds at three matching markers. The available correction subtracts one constant from the sound times. Centering the extreme offsets gives 42.5 milliseconds and residuals -2.5, -0.5 and +2.5 milliseconds.

The receiving use needs that construction for any nonempty finite set of marker offsets, expressed in one common unit and reference. Let m be the smallest offset and M the largest. Construct:

- correction c = (m + M)/2;
- largest residual magnitude r = (M - m)/2.

Every marker offset lies between m and M, so subtracting c leaves each residual between -r and +r. Any constant correction leaves the two extreme residuals separated by M - m. At least one therefore has magnitude at least (M - m)/2. The proposed correction attains that lower bound: it minimizes the largest residual magnitude at these markers.

The reusable operation takes the marker offsets and returns c and r. For a stipulated tolerance T, r at most T supplies a feasible constant correction at the markers; r greater than T shows that no constant correction can meet that marker tolerance. One marker gives r = 0. An empty set supplies no extremes for this construction.

Now add a marker with offset 48 milliseconds. The operation gives c = 44 and r = 4. For a tolerance of 3 milliseconds, every constant correction fails. The two extreme offsets differ by 8 milliseconds, while two residuals each within 3 could differ by at most 6. This failure witness lets the practitioner stop searching among constant shifts and consider another time correspondence or a changed use.

The derivation concerns the supplied marker offsets. Applying a correction throughout a recording also needs the relation between markers and a qualified editing operation; C.39:5.2 retains that receiving question. Unknown drift between markers remains unresolved by this finite calculation.

#### C.39.RO:5.2 - Turn a partition construction into an allocation operation

A workshop has activities A, B, C and D and two sessions. Its stated constraints are pairwise incompatibilities: AB, BC and CD cannot share a session. Activities have no other scheduling or capacity constraints in this constructed case.

B.5 supplies a construction that returns either a two-colouring of a finite undirected graph or an odd-cycle witness. To make it usable for workshop allocation, construct the connection:

1. Make one vertex for each activity and one undirected edge for each incompatibility.
2. Apply the two-colouring operation.
3. Interpret the two colour classes as the sessions. If an odd cycle is returned, read its edges as the incompatible pairs preventing a two-session allocation.

For the supplied path, the operation returns sessions {A,C} and {B,D}. Every incompatibility has endpoints in different sessions.

Generalize from these four activities to any finite set with the same form of pairwise constraint. The encoding preserves exactly the stated prohibition on sharing a session. A two-colouring therefore yields an allocation satisfying every such prohibition. An odd cycle cannot alternate between two sessions all the way around, so it gives a failure witness.

Add incompatibility AC. The triangle A-B-C-A is now an odd-cycle witness. Changing only the session labels cannot repair it. The receiving choice concerns another session, a changed incompatibility or a different activity arrangement.

The reusable contribution is the composition of encoding, the available graph operation and interpretation. If session capacities or precedence constraints are introduced, this operation supplies only the pairwise-compatibility part of the allocation. Those additional constraints need their own construction.

#### C.39.RO:5.3 - Retain a physical condition when reusing a dispensing operation

A dispenser supplied 50 millilitres during a 2.5-second open interval. A proposed reusable operation would dispense a requested volume V by opening for V/20 seconds.

A subject model can justify that operation under a constant flow of 20 millilitres per second over the chosen interval, with the opening and closing effects already accounted for. Under that model, a request for 80 millilitres gives 4 seconds.

Suppose the receiving setup instead has a stated constant flow of 10 millilitres per second. Keeping the old four-second action would supply 40 millilitres. Exposing flow q as an input repairs the construction to duration V/q, for positive q under the stated constant-flow conditions; 80 millilitres then takes 8 seconds.

When flow changes during discharge, V/q with an unqualified constant no longer supplies the volume-duration relation. C.16.MR can construct the measurement relation, and A.3.3.TR can supply the changing-state account. The useful outcome here may be the identified missing relation and continued use of the earlier operation where its original conditions hold.

The numerical cases instantiate supplied models. The single 50-millilitre observation itself supports that observed outcome; a repeatability claim for the real apparatus needs its corresponding physical basis.

### C.39.RO:6 - Bias-Annotation

Under E.3's five Principle-Taxonomy lenses (Gov, Arch, Epist, Prag and Did), this Method favors constructions whose steps and conditions can be recovered. Its mathematical and programming examples make that recovery explicit. Skilled bodily or collective practice may need demonstrations, observation or other descriptions to expose the same operational dependencies.

People and computational agents can contribute different parts of this work: recovering a case, deriving a relation, testing an implementation or supplying a physical condition. Their division of work follows the operations and available capability.

### C.39.RO:7 - Conformance Checklist

### C.39.RO:8 - Common Anti-Patterns and How to Avoid Them

| Anti-pattern | Consequence | Repair |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Copy the successful constants | A later input receives the earlier case's answer. | Recover the relation that selected those constants and apply it to the changed input. |
| Turn every fixed fact into a parameter | A premise needed by the operation disappears. | State the proposed variation and retain or replace the conditions that support it. |
| Hide a missing operation behind a name | The next practitioner can request a result but cannot obtain it. | Recover or construct the step that supplies that result. |
| Compose matching labels | An output reaches a step that needs a different quantity or condition. | Compare the intermediate meanings and application conditions. |
| Extend a physical action from one successful run | A change of apparatus or operating condition defeats the claimed repeatability. | Carry the physical basis and develop the missing relation for the changed use. |
| Discard a failure witness | The practitioner repeats a search that the result already rules out. | Use the obstruction to change the attainable result, permitted operation or next question. |

### C.39.RO:9 - Consequences

A useful case becomes an operation that further work can instantiate and combine. Its exposed conditions also make local revision possible. A failure result can save work by excluding an unattainable request under the current operation.

The added effort is recovering the construction, choosing the intended variation and establishing its scope. It is justified when another use needs the operation. A broader library, a new publication or a fully automated implementation may remain unnecessary for that use.

Reopen the construction when an input meaning, application condition, constituent operation or receiving result changes in a way its current account cannot handle.

### C.39.RO:10 - Architectural Rationale

Case recovery and reusable-operation construction have different results. Recovery makes an existing construction available; this Method changes how it can be instantiated or combined. Keeping the receiving variation explicit prevents expansion into a general library-design task.

Meaningful inputs and conditions hold the proposed scope together. Parameterization exposes variation, composition connects available contributions, and replacement repairs a constituent that no longer serves the use. Their subject arguments explain why the resulting operation works.

The timing case derives a family of conditional results. The allocation case composes a representation change with an existing algorithm. The dispensing case shows where a mathematical rule depends on a physical account. Together they connect mathematical construction, computational performance and physical application while retaining the different work each requires.

An operation can be described in different forms. Its use depends on recoverable meaning and available performance, while formal Method and description classifications are governed by their own patterns.

### C.39.RO:11 - SoTA-Echoing

For the question “How does a useful construction become an operation another use can vary?”, the selected line combines constructive generalization with explicit application conditions and examination of a changed use. It exposes the obtaining step and its scope before investing in a larger reusable library.

For the timing case, compare carrying the earlier 42.5-millisecond correction with carrying the midpoint operation. Both use the same available marker data. Copying the constant is sufficient for the unchanged case; after the 48-millisecond marker is added it leaves a largest residual of 5.5 milliseconds. Computing the new extremes costs a scan of the markers and yields the best constant correction, with a 4-millisecond residual bound and a proof that the 3-millisecond target is unattainable. Adopt the operation when changed data or a feasibility question makes that additional work useful.

[Grand et al., LILO (2024), §3 and §4.1–4.2](https://arxiv.org/html/2310.19791v2) connect reusable program components with further synthesis. Their comparison also shows that components can be hard to use when their names obscure their operations; generated explanations can introduce semantic errors. Adapt this contribution in :4.3/:4.6: expose the operation and describe its actual meaning. Their experiments concern three programming benchmarks and specific earlier language models.

[Ahmed et al., TheoryCoder-2 (2026 preprint), §2.2–3](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.00929v1) connect abstract operators with predicates, a lower-level world model and executable actions, then reuse the operators across related game environments. Adapt the connection between proposed effect and obtaining operations in :4.3/:4.4. The reported transfer uses those representational assumptions and game settings.

The source synthesis supports constructive reuse without requiring the whole automated learning system for an individual operation. Reopen the selected approach when another available Method already supplies the intended reusable result more affordably, when the operation's explanation obstructs its use, or when the receiving variation exposes an unsupported condition.
