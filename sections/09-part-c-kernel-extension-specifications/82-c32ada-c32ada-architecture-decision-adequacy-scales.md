## C.32.ADA - Architecture Decision Adequacy Scales

> **Type:** Architecture evaluation pattern under C.32
> **Status:** Stable
> **Normativity:** Normative unless explicitly marked informative

### C.32.ADA:1 - Problem frame

Use this pattern when a project architecture decision, its method docking, or its ADR-like publication projection must be evaluated for adequacy before use, review, handoff, governance, or improvement.

Primary working reader: an architect, reviewer, or architecture-responsible practitioner checking whether a project architecture decision is good enough for a declared use and which repair should happen next.

Typical entry phrases:

```text
"The decision is written, but can developers actually use it?"
"The ADR looks complete; is the architecture decision itself adequate?"
"Which part is weak: candidate basis, trade-off, method instruction, work split, or publication projection?"
"We need a scale like E.21, but for architecture decisions rather than pattern quality."
"Do not average the decision; tell us what must be repaired."
```

**First-minute use slice.** `ArchitectureReviewService-4` first has the A.13 core for decision-adequacy evaluation, and A.15.1 independently admits `DecisionAdequacyEvaluationWork-12` from 10:00 to 10:20 on 2026-08-12. The Work enacts `DecisionAdequacyEvaluationMethod-2` and occurs within the `U.System` named `ProjectArchitectureReviewService-4`. This slice expressly represents evaluator accountability: `ArchitectureReviewerAssignment-6` is an obtaining occurrence of directly declared species `ArchitectureReviewerAssignment`, held by the already recovered performer and covering the Work, and the separate F.6 relation is recorded. A Work-only ADA record would omit those assignment and attribution refs; failed F.6 would leave the evaluation Work intact. One separate result episteme states the declared use and coordinate outcomes. It does not approve the decision; it directs the exact bounded repairs needed before the decision can guide developer Work.

The primary governed object is `ArchitectureDecisionAdequacyEvaluation@Project`: a C.32.ADA-local evaluation record over one `ArchitectureDecisionRelation@Project`, optional `ArchitectureDecisionRecordProjection@Project`, and declared use. It is not the evaluated decision, evaluation Work, or result episteme.

`ArchitectureDecisionAdequacyEvaluation@Project` is a local record form, not a new `U.*` kind, gate, evidence, assurance, pattern-quality evaluation, or replacement for `C.32.PAD`. Its coordinate table expresses the ADA result content; when that result must be a durable claim, one separately identified C.2.1 episteme states it. The dated evaluation remains separate `U.Work`, and any actual evaluation operation application remains with its subject pattern.

What goes wrong if C.32.ADA is missed: a decision can appear complete because it has a record, rationale, or diagram, while it is unusable for the declared work. Weak candidate basis, hidden trade-offs, missing method instructions, absent source-return, and vague supersession conditions remain invisible until implementation or review fails.

What C.32.ADA buys in practice: the project can evaluate architecture decisions by complete coordinate set, keep kinds distinct, and repair the weakest live coordinates without turning adequacy into a single score.

Ordinary working move: declare the evaluation use, evaluate every coordinate with an ordinal value and rationale, then state the repair condition for each weak coordinate and cite the smallest subject-pattern locus containing the required definition or constraint.

Adoption test: after using C.32.ADA, another practitioner can see the declared use, complete coordinate values, rationales, repair targets, and stop condition for the architecture decision.

Not this pattern when the current object is FPF pattern quality, measurement validity, evidence support, assurance, gate passage, candidate synthesis, comparison, selection, local choice, or ADR publication projection itself. Use the pattern for the next question named in `Relations`.

The first useful output is `ArchitectureDecisionAdequacyEvaluation@Project`:

```text
ArchitectureDecisionAdequacyEvaluation@Project:
  projectWorkOccurrenceRef?: U.EntityRef constrained to U.Work
  architectureDecisionEvaluationProjectUseRelationRef?: U.RelationRef governed by the exact evaluation-use or work-use pattern

      evidenceOrSourceRefs?
      repairPatternRef?
      repairInstruction:
  strongestBlockingCoordinates:
  noAveragePolicy: true
  stopCondition:
  reevaluationTrigger:
```

Here `@Project` is a compatibility and retrieval cue only. A project-local ADA record names both the composite `U.Work` in `projectWorkOccurrenceRef` and the obtaining record-use relation in `architectureDecisionEvaluationProjectUseRelationRef`; the evaluated decision's own project relation, the suffix, or either field alone is insufficient. `evaluatorSystemRoleKindRef` and `evaluatorSystemRoleClassificationJudgmentRef` remain optional and separate. When actual evaluation is claimed, the evaluator first has its A.13 core and `evaluationWorkRef` names Work independently admitted under A.15.1. Assignment species, occurrence, and `evaluationPerformedUnderAssignmentRef` are optional and appear only when the record or receiving use expressly represents precise assignment-bound attribution; any present F.6 ref uses the same obtaining A.13 assignment, and its absence or failure leaves the Work intact. Any operation application and result episteme remain separate. Kind, classification, assignment, Work, attribution, application, responsibility, and result do not substitute for one another.

### C.32.ADA:2 - Problem

Architecture-decision adequacy concerns several distinct objects. A decision relation can be strong while its ADR projection is weak. A record can be readable while the decision lacks candidate traceability. A candidate basis can be strong while method docking is absent. A method instruction can be clear while the architecture-characteristic trade-off is hidden.

A single overall grade or average score hides these differences. Adequacy must be evaluated by coordinates tied to the declared use. "Ready for internal architecture review", "ready for developer work", "ready for ADR publication", and "ready for governance enforcement" can require different stop conditions, but each use still needs complete coordinate inspection.

C.32.ADA supplies an E.21-shaped ordinal evaluation pattern for architecture decisions. It uses the E.21 value domain and labels directly, then defines architecture-decision coordinates over PAD relation, method docking, publication projection, structural description, characteristic trade-off, and evolution. Weak coordinates point back to `C.32.PAD`, `C.32.ADR`, `C.30.AD`, `A.15`, `C.32.ACS`, `C.32.ACE`, `C.16`, `C.25`, or another subject pattern.

### C.32.ADA:3 - Forces

| Force | Tension |
|---|---|
| Decision complexity | One architecture decision carries candidate, structure, characteristic, method, work, publication, and evolution content. |
| Declared use | A decision can be adequate for discussion and inadequate for developer work or governance. |
| Repair focus | Review must point to the smallest repair locus, not produce a general complaint. |
| No average | A strong rationale cannot compensate for absent work split or missing source-return. |
| Kind precision | Eval results, evidence, assurance, gates, and publication records must stay distinct from adequacy evaluation. |
| Evolution | The evaluation must expose reopen and supersession weakness before the decision becomes stale. |

### C.32.ADA:4 - Solution

Create `ArchitectureDecisionAdequacyEvaluation@Project` for one declared use. Evaluate the complete coordinate set. Do not average coordinate values. Use the weakest live coordinate to choose the next repair.

#### C.32.ADA:4.1 - Shared value meanings

Use the same ordinal value domain and labels as `E.21`. ADA specializes what counts as expression for architecture-decision adequacy; it does not create a second scale.

| Value | Label | Architecture-decision adequacy meaning |
|---:|---|---|
| `0` | `absent` | The coordinate is not expressed for the declared architecture-decision use. |
| `1` | `namedOnly` | The coordinate is named or implied, but cannot support reliance, action, evaluation, or repair. |
| `2` | `partiallyExpressedForDeclaredUse` | The coordinate is present but incomplete, fragile, misplaced, or too narrow for the declared use. |
| `3` | `sufficientlyExpressedForDeclaredUse` | The coordinate can support the declared use in the current project, with limits visible. |
| `4` | `wellExpressedForDeclaredUse` | The coordinate has clear refs, boundaries, source-return, and repair path for likely project changes. |
| `5` | `exceptionallyExpressedForDeclaredUse` | The coordinate is well expressed and transferable across another team, later slice, or adjacent holon kind with minimal recovery work and no hidden neighbor loss. |

Values are ordinal content evaluations. They are not measures, averages, votes, maturity ladder names, evidence weights, assurance levels, gate statuses, or implementation approval.

The result-bearing coordinate row uses the E.21 label domain with an architecture-decision coordinate:

| Coordinate | Value | Label | ShortRationale |
|---|---:|---|---|
| `<ADA coordinate>` | `<0..5>` | `<E.21 label>` | `<for 1..4, why the lower adjacent value would understate the expressed content and the higher adjacent value would overstate it; for 0, why 1 would overstate it and what would raise or reopen; for 5, what makes 4 too weak and what would lower or reopen>` |

`5` is not required for every use. Stop conditions are declared before evaluation. A lower diagnostic floor may be used for exploration or internal discussion, but it does not make the decision ready for developer work, implementation commitment, or governance enforcement.

#### C.32.ADA:4.2 - Complete coordinate set

Evaluate every coordinate. If a coordinate is not live, mark it `notTriggered` only with a short reason grounded in the declared use.

| Coordinate | What is evaluated | Repair when weak |
|---|---|---|
| `BoundedDecisionQuestionRecoverability` | Decision subject, described holon, exact `U.ClaimScope`, relevant A.2.6 `U.ContextSlice` membership, effective reference scheme and plane, evaluation window, status, and decision question can be recovered; a selected `BoundedModelUseStructure` is named only when it independently changes interpretation. | Repair the exact missing decision-subject, scope, slice, or model-use-structure assertion using `C.32.PAD`, A.2.6, or A.1.1. |
| `CandidateBasisAndSelectionTraceability` | Candidate palette, residual frame, comparison, selection, selected set, or reason no candidate-set question is live is recoverable. | Repair the missing candidate, comparison, or selection assertion using the exact applicable content in `C.32`, `C.32.MLAO`, `A.19.CPM`, `A.19.SelectorMechanism`, `G.5`, or `C.11`. |
| `AffectedStructureAndDescriptionAdequacy` | Affected selected structures, views, architecture descriptions, correspondence, structural-information lens uses, and source-return are recoverable. | Repair the exact missing structure, description, correspondence, or lens-use assertion using `C.30`, `C.30.ASV`, `C.30.AD`, `A.6.F`, `A.6.M`, or `C.29`. |
| `ArchitectureCharacteristicTradeoffAdequacy` | Architecture characteristics, criteria rows, Q-Bundles, eval readings, accepted losses, and guardrails are explicit. | Repair the exact missing characteristic, criterion, reading, loss, or guardrail assertion using `C.32.ACS`, `C.32.HCS`, `C.25`, `C.32.ACE`, `C.16`, `C.31`, or `C.31.ASAP`. |
| `MethodAndWorkDockingAdequacy` | Method-use instructions, exact intended or acting Systems, Work boundaries, readiness, and expected structure effects are usable. Intended assignment requirements remain modal; actual assignment and F.6 attribution are required only when the instruction or evaluation expressly consumes precise assignment-bound attribution. Responsibility remains independently governed. | Repair the exact missing MethodDescription, Method, A.13 performer basis, A.15.1 Work fact, optional direct assignment species and F.6 attribution, responsibility predicate or missing governor, readiness, or expected-effect assertion using `A.15`, `A.15.1`, `A.15.2`, `A.15.5`, `E.8`, `E.11.PUR`, `A.6.RCD`, or `C.24`. |
| `ArchitectDeveloperSplitAdequacy` | Structures fixed by the decision, refinement left open to developers, holon-transition or BOSC-triggered boundary refs, and source-return condition are explicit. | Repair the exact split or claim-kind assertion using `C.32.PAD`, `A.15`, or `B.2.P`; use `B.2` only when whole reidentification is triggered. |
| `PublicationProjectionAdequacy` | ADR-like or other publication projection carries the needed section functions for the declared readers. | Use `C.32.ADR` for the exact projection, `E.17` for a source-backed publication face and source return, and `E.24.PUB` for the publication occurrence, form, carrier bearing, audience, and availability. |
| `EvidenceEvalAndGateExitAdequacy` | Eval, evidence, assurance, gate, or institutional-governance assertions are named only when live, with their exact predicates and subject-pattern locators. | Repair the exact assertion using `C.32.ACE`, `C.16`, `A.10`, `B.3`, `A.21`, or the named institutional-governance content. |
| `EvolutionAndReopenConditionAdequacy` | Reopen, supersession, stronger-source return, and changed-context triggers are clear. | Repair the exact reopen, supersession, archive/front, improvement, or source-currentness assertion using `C.32.PAD`, `C.32.FAIL`, `C.18`, `C.19`, or `E.23`. |
| `TransformerTransformedCorrespondenceAdequacy` | Required correspondence between transformer-side and transformed-side structures is present when the decision depends on it. | Repair the exact correspondence, Method/Work, Transformation, or flow-structure assertion using `C.32.CONWAY`, `A.15`, `A.3.4`, `A.3.4.P`, or `E.18`. |
| `NonOverreadAndSubjectAssertionAdequacy` | The decision, description, publication, Method, eval, evidence, assurance, and gate claims remain distinct subject assertions with exact defining or constraining ClaimGraphs. | Repair the exact overread, relation, wording, or name using `A.7`, `A.6.P`, `E.10`, `F.18`, or the subject pattern for the unresolved question. |
| `ConsequenceAndRepairGuidanceAdequacy` | Consequences, accepted losses, weak coordinates, and next repair instructions are actionable for the declared use. | Repair the exact missing consequence, projection function, or coordinate assertion using PAD, ADR, or the coordinate-specific subject pattern. |

#### C.32.ADA:4.3 - Use-specific stop conditions

Declare the use before scoring. Common uses:

| Declared use | Ordinary stop condition |
|---|---|
| Internal architecture discussion | Every triggered coordinate is evaluated; `0 absent` coordinates block reliance, and values below `3 sufficientlyExpressedForDeclaredUse` name the patterns or sources that must be repaired. |
| Ready for architecture review | No triggered coordinate below `3 sufficientlyExpressedForDeclaredUse`; candidate basis, trade-off, affected structures, work split, and reopen condition are strong enough for reviewers to inspect by value. |
| Ready for developer work or implementation commitment | Every triggered coordinate is at least `4 wellExpressedForDeclaredUse` unless a governing project decision explicitly declares a lower diagnostic floor and says the result is not an implementation commitment. |
| Ready for ADR-like publication | Publication projection, section functions, status, source-return, and supersession are at least `4 wellExpressedForDeclaredUse`; if the record will guide developer work, use the developer-work floor too. |
| Ready for governance enforcement | Every triggered coordinate is at least `4 wellExpressedForDeclaredUse`; enforcement status requires a separate current gate, evidence-use, assurance, or governance result. |

Use these as ordinary defaults. A project can declare stricter stop conditions. It must not weaken a triggered coordinate by hiding it under an average, and it must not call a diagnostic result ready for developer work or governance enforcement.

```

| Coordinate | Value | Label | Short rationale and repair |
|---|---:|---|---|
| `BoundedDecisionQuestionRecoverability` | `4` | `wellExpressedForDeclaredUse` | Subject, holon, exact claim scope and selected slices, scheme and plane, window, status, and question are clear; `5` would need transfer evidence across another product-family slice. |
| `CandidateBasisAndSelectionTraceability` | `4` | `wellExpressedForDeclaredUse` | Candidate palette and selected option are cited; `5` would need another team to replay the selection without local recovery. |
| `AffectedStructureAndDescriptionAdequacy` | `4` | `wellExpressedForDeclaredUse` | Module and information structures plus C.30.ASV refs are usable; `5` would need a worked cross-team source-return case. |
| `ArchitectureCharacteristicTradeoffAdequacy` | `3` | `sufficientlyExpressedForDeclaredUse` | Substitutability gain and latency loss are named, but guardrail eval rows are incomplete; repair through `C.32.ACS`, `C.32.ACE`, `C.25`, and `C.16`. |
| `MethodAndWorkDockingAdequacy` | `2` | `partiallyExpressedForDeclaredUse` | The ADR says "use events" but lacks a MethodDescription, an exact acting System for that instruction, a readiness boundary, and an expected structure effect. It also expressly requires accountable implementation under `ServiceTeamAssignment` while supplying neither the exact species/current occurrence nor an F.6 attribution for the already claimed Work. Repair those separate PAD and A.15 assertions; a Work-only instruction would not incur the attribution gap. |
| `ArchitectDeveloperSplitAdequacy` | `3` | `sufficientlyExpressedForDeclaredUse` | The acting systems and their Work split are clear, but the developer-side schema-refinement instruction lacks a source-return threshold. If responsibility is part of the decision, cite its admitted direct predicate, participants, applicability, and identity or return its exact missing governor; repair the exact PAD assertion and, if level pressure is real, the exact B.2.P or B.2 assertion. |
| `PublicationProjectionAdequacy` | `4` | `wellExpressedForDeclaredUse` | ADR section functions are mapped; `5` would need a replayed package-update or supersession case. |
| `EvidenceEvalAndGateExitAdequacy` | `3` | `sufficientlyExpressedForDeclaredUse` | Evaluation and gate continuation conditions are named but not replayable enough for developer commitment; repair the exact predicates and assertions located through `C.32.ACE`, `C.16`, `A.10`, `B.3`, or `A.21` as triggered. |
| `EvolutionAndReopenConditionAdequacy` | `4` | `wellExpressedForDeclaredUse` | Reopen triggers cover latency and schema-version pressure; `5` would need an executed supersession slice. |
| `TransformerTransformedCorrespondenceAdequacy` | `3` | `sufficientlyExpressedForDeclaredUse` | Toolchain and product-structure correspondence is locally stated; repair through `C.32.CONWAY` if it becomes load-bearing for work organization. |
| `NonOverreadAndSubjectAssertionAdequacy` | `4` | `wellExpressedForDeclaredUse` | Decision, ADR, method, eval, and gate claims are handled under their subject patterns; `5` would need a near-miss showing avoided overread. |
| `ConsequenceAndRepairGuidanceAdequacy` | `4` | `wellExpressedForDeclaredUse` | Consequences and repair loci are actionable; `5` would need transfer evidence across another holon kind. |

**PAD adequate, ADR weak.** A fixture architecture decision relation can reach `4 wellExpressedForDeclaredUse` on every triggered PAD, Method, work-split, trade-off, and reopen coordinate while the trade-study memo omits status and supersession. ADA identifies only the missing publication-projection assertion and cites `C.32.ADR`; it does not rewrite the PAD relation.

**ADR readable, PAD weak.** A Markdown ADR can have clear headings, status, context, decision, and consequences while the project relation lacks candidate basis, affected selected structures, and Method/Work docking. ADA identifies those missing assertions and cites `C.32.PAD`, `C.32`, and `A.15` as their subject-pattern locators; template completeness does not make the architecture decision adequate.

### C.32.ADA:5 - Archetypal Grounding

**Developer-work readiness.** A service architecture decision has strong candidate traceability and trade-off rationale, but the ADR only says "teams should use events". ADA gives `MethodAndWorkDockingAdequacy = 2 partiallyExpressedForDeclaredUse` because the acting Systems, MethodDescription, expected structure effect, and readiness condition are not recoverable from the instruction. In this case the ADR also expressly requires accountable implementation under an exact assignment, so the absent assignment species/current occurrence and F.6 relation are additional attribution defects; a Work-only instruction would not require them. Any responsibility claim must cite its direct domain predicate or exact missing governor.

**ADR-publication readiness.** A manufacturing architecture decision is clear, but the trade-study memo omits status and supersession. ADA gives `PublicationProjectionAdequacy = 2 partiallyExpressedForDeclaredUse` and `EvolutionAndReopenConditionAdequacy = 3 sufficientlyExpressedForDeclaredUse`. The repair states the missing record-status and supersession assertions using C.32.ADR.

**Architecture review.** A method-family architecture decision has candidate options and Method instructions, but no declared architecture characteristics. ADA gives `ArchitectureCharacteristicTradeoffAdequacy = 0 absent`. The repair states the missing characteristic assertions using C.32.ACS and C.25 before review can judge the decision.

**Governance enforcement.** A toolchain-product correspondence decision depends on team and tool structures. ADA evaluates `TransformerTransformedCorrespondenceAdequacy`; if the correspondence refs are absent, the repair states the missing correspondence assertion using C.32.CONWAY before institutional governance can constrain Method use.

### C.32.ADA:6 - Bias-Annotation

| Risk handled | How C.32.ADA handles it |
|---|---|
| Record completeness as adequacy | ADR projection is one coordinate, not the whole evaluation. |
| Average-score drift | Coordinate values are not averaged; weak coordinates drive repair. |
| Generic review prose | Each weak coordinate names a governing repair pattern. |
| Gate confusion | ADA does not approve, certify, assure, or pass a gate. |
| Hidden method failure | Method and work docking has its own coordinate. |
| Evolution blindness | Reopen, supersession, and source-return have explicit coordinates. |

### C.32.ADA:7 - Conformance Checklist

| Requirement | Required result |
|---|---|
| `CC-ADA-1` | Declared use and stop condition are written before evaluation. |
| `CC-ADA-2` | The evaluated decision relation and optional ADR projection are cited. |
| `CC-ADA-3` | Every coordinate is scored `0 absent` through `5 exceptionallyExpressedForDeclaredUse` or marked `notTriggered` with a grounded reason. |
| `CC-ADA-4` | Every value has adjacent-value rationale, not only a number. |
| `CC-ADA-5` | No coordinate values are averaged or converted into one global score. |
| `CC-ADA-6` | Weak coordinates name repair pattern refs and repair instructions. |
| `CC-ADA-7` | Evidence, assurance, gate, measurement, eval, publication, Method, Work, and pattern-quality claims remain distinct subject assertions and cite their exact defining or constraining ClaimGraphs. |
| `CC-ADA-8` | A project-local ADA record names both `projectWorkOccurrenceRef` and `architectureDecisionEvaluationProjectUseRelationRef`; the evaluated decision's relation, the suffix, or either field alone asserts no locality. |
| `CC-ADA-9` | A local evaluator kind and a System-classification judgment use separate optional refs and neither requires an assignment. Actual evaluation first recovers the evaluator through A.13 and names independently admitted A.15.1 Work. Assignment species, occurrence, and F.6 refs are optional and appear only when the ADA record or receiving use expressly represents precise assignment-bound attribution; a missing or failed relation leaves the Work intact. An operation application and result episteme remain separate. Kind, classification, assignment, Work, attribution, responsibility, application, and result imply none of the others. |
| `CC-ADA-10` | Every evaluation binds one exact `U.ClaimScope`, relevant A.2.6 `U.ContextSlice` membership, effective reference scheme and plane, evaluation window, and input projection; the declared-use label and coordinate table do not replace them. |

### C.32.ADA:8 - Common Anti-Patterns and How to Avoid Them

| Anti-pattern | Symptom | Repair |
|---|---|---|
| `DecisionAdequacyAverage` | Strong rationale and readable ADR produce a high average despite absent method docking. | Remove the average; use weakest triggered coordinates to choose repair. |
| `ADRCompletenessAsDecisionAdequacy` | The record has all headings, so the decision is treated as adequate. | Evaluate PAD relation, method docking, trade-off, source-return, and reopen conditions separately. |
| `ReviewCommentWithoutRepairPattern` | The reviewer says "unclear" or "not enough detail" without a target repair pattern. | Assign the weak coordinate to `C.32.PAD`, `C.32.ADR`, `A.15`, `C.30.AD`, `C.32.ACS`, or another exact subject pattern. |
| `GateByScale` | A value of `4` or `5` is treated as approval or certification. | Keep ADA as evaluation; use `A.21`, `A.10`, `B.3`, or governance patterns for gate, evidence, assurance, and enforcement claims. |
| `NotTriggeredAsConvenience` | A difficult coordinate is marked not triggered to close the review. | Require a declared-use reason and receiving-pattern boundary; otherwise score it and repair. |
| `MethodDockingSkipped` | The decision is adequate for architecture discussion but then used to direct developer work. | Re-declare use as developer-work readiness and evaluate method docking, work split, and publication handoff. |
| `SystemRoleLabelAsEvaluator` | A reviewer system-role kind, assignment, or ADA record is treated as the performer of evaluation. | Recover the exact admitted evaluator System through A.13 and let A.15.1 independently admit the dated evaluation Work. Add assignment species, occurrence, and F.6 only when precise assignment-bound attribution is expressly represented. Keep any responsibility relation, result episteme, and operation application separate. |
| `ContextLabelAsEvaluationScope` | A project, domain, or bounded-context label stands in for the evaluation boundary. | Bind the exact `U.ClaimScope`, selected context slices, scheme and plane, evaluation window, and decision-question input projection. |

### C.32.ADA:9 - Consequences

| Consequence | Benefit | Cost |
|---|---|---|
| Adequacy is coordinate-based. | Review can point to exact repairs instead of vague approval or rejection. | Evaluation requires inspecting every coordinate and explaining its value. |
| Declared use controls stop condition. | A decision can be adequate for one use and inadequate for another without contradiction. | Teams must state intended use before scoring. |
| No average is allowed. | Weak but critical coordinates stay visible. | Some dashboards and summaries need redesign. |
| Explicit repair conditions and subject-pattern locators are mandatory. | Review results become actionable. | Reviewers must recover the exact missing assertion and the pattern description containing its definition or constraint. |

### C.32.ADA:10 - Rationale

C.32.ADA exists because architecture-decision adequacy is not one property. It is a family of recoverability and use-readiness coordinates across decision relation, selected structures, architecture characteristics, method docking, work split, publication projection, evidence or eval exits, and evolution.

The pattern follows the same discipline as FPF quality evaluation: declared use first, complete coordinate set, ordinal values with rationale, no average, and targeted repair. It remains architecture-specific because the coordinates are tied to PAD, ADR projection, architecture descriptions, candidate synthesis, method-use instructions, and architecture-characteristic trade-offs.

| Source to inspect | Why this source is load-bearing here | Transfer into ADA | Concrete ADA mutation | Blocked overread |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Current FPF `E.21` scale discipline | Existing FPF pattern for declared-use evaluation, exact `0 absent` through `5 exceptionallyExpressedForDeclaredUse` labels, complete coordinates, adjacent-value rationale, and no averaging. | Reuse the value domain and evaluation discipline for architecture decisions without copying pattern-quality coordinates. | ADA requires declared use, complete coordinate set, E.21 value labels with adjacent rationale, no average, and use-specific stop conditions. | E.21 pattern-quality status and coordinates are not architecture-decision adequacy. |
| `C.32.PAD` and `C.32.ADR` | PAD and ADR define the decision relation and publication projection being evaluated. | Make relation adequacy and projection adequacy separate coordinates. | ADA can say a PAD relation is usable while ADR projection needs repair, or the reverse. | A complete ADR does not make the decision relation adequate. |
| ISO/IEC/IEEE 42010:2022 official standard (`https://www.iso.org/standard/74393.html`; IEEE page `https://standards.ieee.org/ieee/42010/6846/`) with the 42010 companion site as secondary reading (`https://iso-architecture.org/42010/`) | Current official source for architecture descriptions, viewpoints, views, correspondence, and rationale; the companion site is used only as secondary reading. | Add coordinates for affected structure, architecture-description adequacy, and source-return. | ADA identifies `C.30.AD` and `C.30.ASV` as subject-pattern locators for weak description assertions. | Architecture-description adequacy does not decide or approve the architecture. |

| 2026 ADR violation-detection research (`https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07609`) | LLM detection in the study was more accurate for explicit decisions checkable from code than for decisions left implicit or requiring deployment settings or organizational context. | Add confirmation, source-return, method, deployment, and organization refs to adequacy checks when live. | ADA scores confirmation and method docking separately and blocks hidden organizational knowledge from passing as ready. | Automated violation detection is not proof, evidence, assurance, or gate passage. |

**Source-currentness boundary.** Recheck a source row when FPF evaluation discipline, architecture-decision practice, ADR violation checking, evolutionary-architecture eval practice, or project governance changes a coordinate, value meaning, or repair exit.

### C.32.ADA:12 - Relations

- **Builds on:** `C.32.PAD`, `C.32.ADR`, `C.32.P2S`, `C.32`, `C.32.MLAO`, `C.32.ACS`, `C.32.ACE`, `C.32.CONWAY`, `C.32.FAIL`, `C.30.AD`, `C.30.ASV`, `A.2.1`, `A.2.6`, `A.15`, `A.15.1`, `A.19`, `C.2.1`, `C.16`, `C.25`, `C.29`, `E.17`, and `E.21`; uses A.1.1 only when a selected `BoundedModelUseStructure` changes evaluation interpretation.
- **Evaluation boundary:** Use ADA only to evaluate architecture-decision adequacy for a declared use. It does not perform candidate synthesis, comparison, selection, selected-set result declaration, actual publication, local choice, evidence support, assurance, gate passage, governance enforcement, or pattern-quality evaluation.
- **Decision and projection boundary:** Use `C.32.PAD` to repair the decision relation and `C.32.ADR` to repair ADR-like publication projection.
- **Description and structure boundary:** Use `C.30`, `C.30.AD`, and `C.30.ASV` for architecture claim, description, and view adequacy.
- **P2S docking:** Use `C.32.P2S` when a weak decision-adequacy row must reopen the connected architecturing flow rather than only repair the decision record.
- **Method and work boundary:** Use `A.15`, `A.15.1`, `A.15.2`, `A.15.5`, `E.8`, `E.11.PUR`, and `C.24` for method, work, readiness, pattern-use, and agentic tool-use claims.
- **Characteristic and eval boundary:** Use `C.32.ACS`, `C.32.HCS`, `C.25`, `C.32.ACE`, `C.16`, `C.31`, and `C.31.ASAP` for characteristic rows, Q-Bundles, eval-program framing, typed measurement or evaluation results, modularity, and scale preference. ADA may inspect references to those objects as coordinate evidence; use their subject patterns for any definition change or actual operation.
- **Evidence, assurance, gate, and governance boundary:** Use `A.10`, `B.3`, `A.21`, and local governance patterns when those claims are live.

### C.32.ADA:13 - Footer marker

C.32.ADA closes when `ArchitectureDecisionAdequacyEvaluation@Project` declares the use and stop condition; binds the exact claim scope and selected context slices, reference scheme and plane, evaluation window, and decision-question input projection; cites the evaluated decision relation and optional projection; evaluates every coordinate with an E.21 value label and rationale or grounded not-triggered status; names weakest blocking coordinates, repair patterns, and repair instructions; avoids average-score replacement; and, when actual evaluation is claimed, keeps the A.13-qualified evaluator System, independently admitted A.15.1 Work, operation application, any responsibility relation, and result episteme separately identified. Assignment species, occurrence, and F.6 attribution are present only when the record expressly represents that precise attribution.
