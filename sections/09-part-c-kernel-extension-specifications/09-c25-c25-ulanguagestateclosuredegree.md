## C.2.5 - `U.LanguageStateClosureDegree`

> **Type:** Definitional (D)
> **Status:** Stable
> **Normativity:** Normative unless marked informative

**Plain-name.** Language-state closure degree.

**Use this pattern when.** Use C.2.5 when a governed `U.Episteme` publication must say how fixed its candidate space, route space, or frame space has become before endpoint use, reopening, or retreat.

**What goes wrong if missed.** A confident tone is mistaken for closure, closure is mistaken for truth or gate authority, or a closure drop leaves endpoint expectations and route commitments silently hanging.

**What this buys.** A separate ordinal characteristic for closure degree, so teams can distinguish exploration, stabilization, selected route, guarded fixation, and admissible retreat without collapsing closure into formality, articulation, warrant, or obligation.

### C.2.5:1 - Problem frame
A governed `U.Episteme` may already be explicit enough for publication while its declared position claim remains intentionally open to rival routes or frames. The declared language-state chart over `U.CharacteristicSpace` therefore needs a separate pattern defining the closure-degree basis slot: how fixed or closed the current candidate space has become.

### C.2.5:2 - Problem
Closure is often hidden inside vague words such as "ready", "settled", or "open". When closure is not explicit, teams cannot reason cleanly about reopen, sketch-backoff, or the admissibility of endpoint docking.

### C.2.5:3 - Forces
| Force | Tension |
|---|---|
| **Commitment vs exploration** | Preserve open search without losing auditability. |
| **Stability vs reversibility** | Allow closure increases, but also admissible reopening and reframing. |
| **Authority vs explicit retreat** | Let strong closure matter, but keep visible the moves that relax it. |

### C.2.5:4 - Solution
`U.LanguageStateClosureDegree` is an ordinal characteristic over how fixed the current candidate set, framing, and admissible next moves are in a published position claim in the declared language-state chart over `U.CharacteristicSpace`.

#### C.2.5:4.0a - Kind and characteristic boundary

`U.LanguageStateClosureDegree` is a dependent durable characteristic value under the declared `U.LanguageStateSpace` / `U.CharacteristicSpace` boundary, not a root U-kind. Its identity is the closure-degree basis slot and ordinal scale discipline for governed episteme publication positions. Claims about local route commitments, gates, or authority states remain separate from the closure-degree claim. When one matters to the current use, test it against its applicable rule and current case facts.

#### C.2.5:4.1 - Characteristic specification
- **Kind:** CHR characteristic.
- **Scale discipline:** ordinal.
- **What rises:** the local state becomes more fixed or more binding.
- **What does not follow automatically:** truth, trust, formality, or quality.

#### C.2.5:4.2 - Starter anchor set
| Anchor | Reading | Typical governance effect |
|---|---|---|
| `CD0` | exploratory-open | broad rival space remains live |
| `CD1` | weakly stabilized | some contrasts are present, but rival routes remain normal |
| `CD2` | narrowed candidate space | explicit rivals remain, but the field is meaningfully reduced |
| `CD3` | selected route or framing | one route is chosen, though reopening remains routine |
| `CD4` | publication- or operation-fixed under guard | changes require named justification |
| `CD5` | strongly fixed | relaxation requires an explicit `A.16.2` move and governance note |

#### C.2.5:4.3 - Non-collapse rules
`LanguageStateClosureDegree` is not:

- `F`;
- articulation explicitness;
- gate decision;
- evaluator confidence;
- warrant strength.

A text may be highly explicit but low-closure, or low-explicitness but already high-closure by policy. Those states shall not be collapsed.

#### C.2.5:4.4 - Change discipline
Increasing `CD` requires narrowing candidate space, route space, or frame space explicitly. Lowering `CD` is admissible only through a named move such as `reopen`, `sketchBackoff`, or `respecify`, with a retained-witness and discarded-assumption note.

An ordinary PatternID in `governingPatternRef` locates the FPF rule relevant to the closure claim. Use a separate `relationFunctionClaimRef` for its exact defining or constraining `ClaimGraph` only when admissible interpretation, comparison, migration, publication, or reuse depends on that exact rule identity (`E.10`, `E.4.PFR`). Use `authoritySourceRef` when a non-pattern source carries the relevant authority.

### C.2.5:5 - Archetypal Grounding
**Tell.** Two notes may look equally explicit, but one is still intentionally open while the other is already committed to a single route.

**Show (System).** An incident cue can be routed to rollback while remaining reopenable if new evidence arrives.

**Show (Episteme).** A hypothesis sketch can be highly articulated but still low closure because rival explanations remain live.

### C.2.5:6 - Bias-Annotation
The pattern makes closure explicit, which resists hidden overconfidence but may feel heavy to authors who prefer implicit consensus.

### C.2.5:7 - Conformance Checklist
- `CC-C.2.5-1` Closure **SHALL** be declared independently from `F` and `AE` when it matters for routing, docking, or reopening.
- `CC-C.2.5-2` Reopen/backoff moves **SHALL** cite the prior closure state they are relaxing.
- `CC-C.2.5-3` Strong-closure states **SHOULD** name the guard, `governingPatternRef`, or `authoritySourceRef` that makes the closure binding.
- `CC-C.2.5-4` A closure drop **SHALL NOT** silently preserve an endpoint-use claim when the supporting route or publication form no longer supports it.

### C.2.5:8 - Common Anti-Patterns and How to Avoid Them
- **Closure by mood.** A sentence sounds decisive, so teams assume high closure. Publish `CD` explicitly.
- **Irreversible drift.** Closure rises informally but no reopening condition exists. Use `A.16.2`.
- **Authority smuggling.** High closure is treated as if it were automatically a gate or obligation. Check the applicable gate condition for a gate claim; use `A.2.8` to check whether the claimed obligation obtains.

### C.2.5:9 - Consequences
The benefit is admissible handling of stabilization, commitment, and reopening. The trade-off is more explicit state declaration and more explicit retreat records.

### C.2.5:10 - Rationale
Closure is the route-governance basis slot that complements articulation within the declared language-state chart over `U.CharacteristicSpace`. `A.16.0` and its seam species need both.

### C.2.5:11 - SoTA-Echoing
The facet aligns with iterative design, open-world reasoning, and exploratory search practices where closure is a governance choice rather than a hidden by-product.

### C.2.5:12 - Relations
- Builds on: `A.18`, `C.2.2a`, `C.2.LS`.
- Coordinates with: `C.2.4`, `A.16.0`, `A.16`, `A.16.1`, `A.16.2`, `B.4.1`, `B.5.2.0`.
- Constrains: reopen, backoff, and endpoint docking guards.
### C.2.5:13 - Worked Examples and Retreat Cases

#### C.2.5:13.1 - Explicit but still open
A note may sit at `AE4` yet only `CD1` because rival explanatory frames are still live. The important lesson is that explicit publication does not imply settled closure.

#### C.2.5:13.2 - Strong closure under policy guard
An operator rule may be only moderate in `AE` but high in `CD` because policy already fixes the next step under the current horizon. This shows why closure is governance-facing, not merely stylistic.

#### C.2.5:13.3 - Reopen case
A route may move from `CD4` back to `CD2` when counter-evidence appears. A conforming publication does not hide this as embarrassment; it records the retreat as an admissible `A.16.2` move.

### C.2.5:14 - Authoring and Review Guidance

#### C.2.5:14.1 - Author prompt
To assign `CD`, ask:

- how many rivals remain live?
- is one route merely preferred, or actually fixed?
- what guard, `governingPatternRef`, or `authoritySourceRef` makes the closure binding?
- what would count as an admissible reopen trigger?

#### C.2.5:14.2 - Review prompt
An assurance reader should ask whether closure is being inferred from tone, from hierarchy, or from social force rather than from an explicit narrowing of route or frame space.

#### C.2.5:14.3 - Governance note
Whenever a claim about a gate, commitment, or endpoint use depends on `CD`, the supporting guard, `governingPatternRef`, or `authoritySourceRef` should be visible.

### C.2.5:15 - Extension and Migration Notes

#### C.2.5:15.1 - Local anchor refinement
Contexts may refine the starter closure anchors, but shall keep the ordinal progression and the explicit link to reopen/backoff discipline.

#### C.2.5:15.2 - Migration from readiness language
Words such as "settled", "closed", "final", or "open" should be treated as migration prompts into explicit `CD` claims and, where needed, into named `A.16.2` moves.

#### C.2.5:15.3 - Boundary reminder
`CD` is not warrant strength and not a gate decision. It speaks only about the local fixity of the current episteme or publication position and its candidate space.
### C.2.5:16 - Closure Publication Package Discipline

#### C.2.5:16.1 - Minimal closure package
A publishable `CD` claim should name what has narrowed:

- the rival routes or frames that remain live;
- the route, frame, or interpretation that is currently privileged or fixed;
- the guard, `governingPatternRef`, `authoritySourceRef`, or policy that makes the narrowing binding;
- the condition under which an admissible reopen or backoff would occur.

A bare claim such as "now settled" is insufficient when closure affects routing or authority.

#### C.2.5:16.2 - Narrowing-source rule
Closure may rise because evidence eliminates rivals, governance temporarily binds a route, or protocol requires fixation under time pressure. State the source of narrowing because different sources imply different reopen expectations.

#### C.2.5:16.3 - Partial-closure rule
Closure may be local rather than global. A note can be closed enough for one route while remaining open about broader explanation or classification; a prompt may be fixed enough to hold one question steady while still open enough that rival answers remain live. Publish that locality explicitly.

### C.2.5:17 - Continuing and Withdrawn Authority Handling

#### C.2.5:17.1 - Authority retention rule
If higher `CD` carried endpoint expectations, guard claims, or route commitments, a closure drop must say which consequences remain and which are withdrawn. Treat any actual authority-relation change separately under its direct pattern, as required by `A.16.2`.

#### C.2.5:17.2 - Admissible retreat record
An admissible retreat through `reopen`, `sketchBackoff`, or `respecify` should retain:

- the prior closure state;
- the reason the prior fixation no longer holds;
- the assumption or route being relaxed;
- the still-binding remainder, if any.

This prevents false continuity after retreat.

#### C.2.5:17.3 - Closure versus obligation boundary
High `CD` may coexist with obligations. When prose treats "closed" as "must now be done", use `A.2.8` to identify the duty bearer, duty, and instituting rule and basis; retain the applicable `governingPatternRef` or `authoritySourceRef` for that obligation claim.

### C.2.5:18 - Review Matrix and Reopen Tests

#### C.2.5:18.1 - Review matrix
An assurance reader should ask:

- what was narrowed;
- by what `governingPatternRef`, `authoritySourceRef`, or guard it was narrowed;
- what would reopen it;
- which gate, release, work, evidence-use, assurance, policy, or adjudication claims depend on the stated closure conditions and remain supported;
- whether the publication distinguishes local closure from whole-context finality.

#### C.2.5:18.2 - False-finality test
Words such as "final", "settled", or "decided" should be challenged unless the route-governance and guard package is explicit. Final-sounding rhetoric often overstates actual closure.

#### C.2.5:18.3 - Cross-facet reminder
Low `CD` does not imply low articulation, low anchoring, or poor representation. Reviewers should not treat openness as low seriousness.

#### C.2.5:18.4 - Split-closure review case
A publication may be closed enough for immediate local work use or reliance use while remaining open about broader explanation, long-horizon consequences, or alternative classification. Allow the split when locality is explicit; reject prose that advertises whole-case finality when only one language-state segment is fixed.
