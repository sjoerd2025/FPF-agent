## C.19.2 - Use-Bounded Apparatus Application

> **Type:** Architectural (A)
> **Status:** Stable
> **Normativity:** Normative

### C.19.2:0 - Use this when

Use this pattern when one practical result matters and a relevant method, model, formalism, assurance technique, ontology, or other direct-kind apparatus is available, but the work needed to configure and apply it may cost more than the result warrants. Start here whether one apparatus is already selected or a real choice among available alternatives has become current.

The first useful move is to name the practical use, result kind, claimed guarantee, constraints, and reuse horizon, then ask whether the next adaptation and application work can reach a useful result within the available budget. This keeps a small, adequate path small while letting repeated or high-consequence use justify richer configuration.

**Not this pattern when.** If an adequate way to obtain the result is still unexplained, use `C.39`. If usable material needs feasible variation and examination, use `C.40`. Use `C.18` when the question concerns the generation account or archive/front stewardship. If the live question is a local choice over an existing option set, use `C.11`. If the blocker is an ontology conflation, use `A.7.1`; if it is a material conflict among FPF premises, use `A.7.2`.

The primary working reader is an engineer, method or model selector, or technical lead. That reader position is not a system-role kind or assignment. This pattern is a `U.MethodDescription` episteme whose claims describe one admitted `U.Method`. When an admitted `U.System` performs dated configuration or application `U.Work` using that Method, first recover the performer's A.13 core and independently admit the Work under A.15.1. Add F.6 afterward only when the present use needs precise assignment-bound attribution. Show an assignment identifier, species, participants, and attribution detail only when that use relies on them, attribution is ambiguous, or the source wording must be repaired. The problem-facing result remains with the pattern that defines or tests it.

### C.19.2:1 - Problem frame

A team can have a rich apparatus and still lack an economical way to use it. A maintenance group may need only one typed relation distinction for a one-off repair, an architecture team may need a carefully configured model across hundreds of handoffs, and an assurance team may need a formal technique only after the required guarantee becomes stronger. In each case, displaying more apparatus is easier than proving that its setup work changes the result.

The governed concern is one bounded apparatus application for one declared use and horizon. The apparatus retains its direct kind; this pattern does not introduce a generic `U.Apparatus` kind. The application question is distinct from candidate generation, local choice, planning, performed work, and the domain result.

### C.19.2:2 - Problem

Without a use-bounded application method, users make two symmetrical mistakes. They configure an entire rich basis because it is available, or they keep a lightweight path after recurrence, automation, transfer, or consequence would repay a more capable configuration. They may also call candidate generation “choice”, call a choice record a work plan, or treat an application note as the practical result.

The failure is not merely excess documentation. It obscures who performs the work, what result the work must produce, which guarantee is being claimed, and which neighboring pattern contains the defining content for the next question.

### C.19.2:3 - Forces

| Force | Tension |
|---|---|
| Early value vs richer assurance | A useful result should arrive before exhaustive configuration, but higher consequence may justify deeper setup. |
| One current path vs live alternatives | Inventing rivals creates bureaucracy; ignoring genuine alternatives can lock in avoidable cost or loss. |
| Local economy vs reuse | One-off work favors a small path; repeated work can amortize configuration and improve transfer. |
| Direct kinds vs shared comparison | Unlike candidates must retain their kinds while being compared against one declared use and guarantee. |
| Method guidance vs actual work | A practitioner can use a `U.MethodDescription` episteme as guidance when performing the configuration or application work. |

### C.19.2:4 - Solution

#### C.19.2:4.1 - Keep the five positions separate

Use this minimal lens before taking a branch:

1. **Declared use:** the practical question, direct result kind, claimed guarantee, non-negotiable constraints, and horizon.
2. **Selected or candidate direct-kind object:** the method description, model, ontology module, formal technique, or other governed object being considered.
3. **Application MethodDescription and described Method:** this pattern's `U.MethodDescription` episteme and the admitted `U.Method` it describes. A practitioner uses its claims to guide the Work.
4. **Performer and work:** when an admitted `U.System` performs dated configuration or application `U.Work` using the described Method, recover its A.13 core and independently admit the Work under A.15.1. Add F.6 afterward only when the present use needs precise assignment-bound attribution. In a short account, expose assignment identity, species, participants, or attribution detail only when the use relies on them, attribution is ambiguous, or source wording must be repaired.
5. **Problem-facing result:** the domain, engineering, assurance, architecture, or other subject-pattern result inspected after the work.

The intended reader may also be the person-system that performs the Work, but reader position and performer relation remain different.

#### C.19.2:4.2 - Select the truthful application branch

**One current apparatus.** When one direct-kind apparatus is already selected and still has a credible path to the declared result and guarantee, create no `OptionSet` and no `ChoiceResult`. Compare the smallest next adaptation/configuration work with the useful-result threshold, plan when needed, perform the work, and inspect the result.

**Candidate generation or reframing.** If no adequate current object is available, use `C.39` to develop a missing explanation of how to obtain the result, or `C.40` to vary usable material and examine the difference. Use `C.18` when generation-account or archive/front claims are needed. The declared use and eligibility basis can guide that work.

**Local choice.** Only when two or more already-available eligible alternatives, or another genuine local-choice question over a live set, are current, use `C.11` for `OptionSet`, `ChoiceRule`, probing, and `ChoiceResult`.

**Post-choice enactment.** For a singular selected direct-kind object, use `A.15.2` to plan its application when a plan is needed and `A.15.1` for the dated application Work. `C.24` is the pattern for sequencing, budgeting, checkpointing, and replanning only when the application involves tool-call work.

#### C.19.2:4.3 - Admit candidates by one use-bounded predicate

`UseBoundedApparatusCandidateEligibilityPredicate@Context` is a local eligibility predicate, not a U-kind, relation kind, or candidate-generation method. A candidate is eligible only when it has a credible adaptation path to the same declared use, direct result kind, claimed guarantee, scope and horizon, and non-negotiable constraints. A candidate that cannot meet one of those values stays outside the current option set rather than becoming a “weaker” member of it.

When the claimed guarantee or requirement itself is disputed, use `C.11.DUA` to appraise its purpose, contribution, burden and current force. Keep apparatus eligibility under the current declaration separate from that appraisal. Resume application under a revised declaration only when the change is available through the authority or agreement that governs it.

When choice is current, preserve the exact `C.11` contract:

- `choose now` names one selected option or an honestly retained tie-set;
- `reject current set` returns to a named candidate-generation pattern or closes with no current application;
- `probe again` retains one probe and its epistemic budget because it can still change the choice;
- `reroute` names the actual neighboring question and its subject pattern.

These four dispositions form the complete current `C.11` result set. “Configure the rich basis”, “adapt again”, and “use a lighter method” are option or plan contents, not extra choice-result values. A tie is not a hidden winner.

#### C.19.2:4.4 - Perform the bounded application

1. State the practical use, direct result kind, claimed guarantee, constraints, horizon, and current apparatus state.
2. If one apparatus is already selected, test its credible adaptation path without inventing choice. If candidates are missing, use `C.39` for an unexplained way to obtain the result or `C.40` for feasible variation and examination of usable material. Add `C.18` only when a generation account or archive/front claim is needed.
3. Name available alternatives by their direct kinds and apply the shared eligibility predicate.
4. For each current path, state the smallest adaptation/configuration work and the useful-result threshold: what must be learned, evidenced, integrated, or reviewed before the path can improve the use.
5. Compare available time and budget, prior exposure, post-threshold efficiency, transfer, retention, interoperability, downside, reversibility, and expected reuse using values supplied by their subject patterns. Do not compress them into an undeclared scalar.
6. If choice is current, consume one lawful `C.11 ChoiceResult`; otherwise continue on the one-apparatus path.
7. On a branch that proceeds to application, prepare the needed `A.15.2` plan or, for tool-call enactment, `C.24` call plan. Have the admitted system perform `A.15.1` work.
8. Inspect the separately governed problem-facing result. Keep an application/configuration note only when reuse, dispute, automation, or consequence makes it useful.

#### C.19.2:4.5 - Stop and reopen

Stop when the direct result is usable at the claimed guarantee and no additional distinction or setup burden has an expected practical return for the declared use and horizon. This is a positive result, not a claim that the unused apparatus is inferior.

Reopen when a consequential counterexample, failed result, changed use or guarantee, changed recurrence horizon, new candidate path, automation need, or changed adaptation cost alters the lawful path. Reopen only the affected application, candidate, choice, plan, or work question under its subject pattern.

#### C.19.2:4.6 - Optional demonstration, not an admitted structure

A short branch presentation may show one-apparatus, candidate-generation, choose, probe/reject, application, result, and reopen continuations as a `ProvisionalUnfoldingDemonstrationDescription@Context`. It is an episteme for teaching. The presentation alone establishes no admitted `U.Structure`, CGUS, work plan, work occurrence, or problem-facing result; CGUS admission requires every `A.22.CGUS` coordinate independently.

### C.19.2:5 - Archetypal Grounding

**Repeated audited handoffs.** A fleet has 400 maintenance handoffs each year. The required result is an audited maintenance-decision episteme with a fixed safety and interoperability guarantee. Candidate generation is complete: an ontology-backed method description and a lighter local decision method are eligible; a spreadsheet macro is excluded because it cannot preserve required relation-occurrence identity. `C.11` returns `choose now` for the ontology-backed method because recurrence amortizes configuration.

An admitted maintenance-information System performs the dated configuration and application Work using the selected ontology-backed Method. The account recovers the System's A.13 core and independently admits the Work under A.15.1. Because the current question is whether setup cost is repaid across the handoffs and consumes no exact assignment-bound attribution, this short example does not open F.6 or expose assignment identity, species, participants, or attribution detail. A later attribution-bearing claim adds F.6 through the same obtaining A.13 assignment.

A separately admitted maintenance-decision System then performs decision Work using the selected Method. Its A.13 core and independent A.15.1 Work admission are recoverable; this setup-cost example consumes no exact assignment-bound attribution, so F.6 remains unopened. Under `A.6.1`, application `MaintenanceDecisionApplication-1` of operation `DecideMaintenance`, declared by `MaintenanceDecisionMechanism-E1`, returns `AuditedMaintenanceDecision-1` under result declaration `DecisionResult`; no Work-to-result or production claim is made. If repair or audit cost does not fall after the declared sample, reopen the apparatus application.
**One-off naming repair.** A team already has the direct typed-relation method for one local, reversible naming decision. No rival is live and the current method has a credible small path, so no option set or choice result is created. The team performs the minimal wording and typing work and returns a scoped terminology decision. Recurrence, integration, a failed result, or a stronger guarantee may later open candidate generation and choice.

**Non-use.** If the blocked result comes from missing telemetry while the method, state kinds, and action distinctions are already clear, return to measurement and evidence work. Apparatus selection cannot manufacture the missing observation.

### C.19.2:6 - Bias-Annotation

Applicable bias lenses: **Gov**, **Arch**, **Onto/Epist**, **Prag**, **Did**. Scope: cross-domain bounded application work.

The main bias is prestige-by-apparatus: richer form, newer tooling, or familiar terminology is treated as practical superiority. The mitigation is one declared result and guarantee, direct-kind candidates, actual adaptation/work cost, and a positive one-apparatus path. A second bias is automation optimism; cheaper computation does not erase evidence, human attention, integration, or consequence review.

### C.19.2:7 - Conformance Checklist

| ID | Check |
|---|---|
| `CC-C19.2-1` | The declared use names a direct result kind, guarantee, constraints, and horizon. |
| `CC-C19.2-2` | A current single-apparatus case proceeds without a fabricated `OptionSet` or `ChoiceResult`. |
| `CC-C19.2-3` | Candidate generation, local choice, planning, tool-call planning, dated work, and direct result retain their subject patterns. |
| `CC-C19.2-4` | Every candidate retains its direct kind and satisfies one explicit eligibility predicate for the same use and guarantee. |
| `CC-C19.2-5` | Any `C.11` result is exactly `choose now`, `reject current set`, `probe again`, or `reroute`. |
| `CC-C19.2-6` | The intended-reader position, `U.MethodDescription` episteme, described `U.Method`, admitted performing `U.System`, dated `U.Work`, and problem-facing result remain distinct. Every precise performer has an A.13 core, and the Work is independently admitted under A.15.1. F.6 is required only when the receiving use also needs precise assignment-bound attribution. A short projection exposes assignment identity, species, participants, or attribution detail only when that use relies on them, attribution is ambiguous, or source wording must be repaired. |
| `CC-C19.2-7` | The first useful result and stop are practical, and every reopen condition changes a named next action. |
| `CC-C19.2-8` | No generic apparatus U-kind, hidden scalar, or unadmitted CGUS is introduced. |

### C.19.2:8 - Common Anti-Patterns and How to Avoid Them

| Anti-pattern | Repair |
|---|---|
| Configure everything because the basis is rich. | Name the useful-result threshold and retain only setup work with expected return. |
| Invent a rival to make the method look comparative. | Use the one-apparatus path until candidate or choice work is genuinely current. |
| Call candidate generation a choice. | Use `C.39` to explain a missing way or `C.40` to vary and examine usable material; let `C.11` operate on the existing eligible set. Add `C.18` when the generation account or archive/front claim matters. |
| Treat the apparatus-choice `ChoiceResult` as an application plan or the problem-facing result. | Keep selected object, plan, dated work, application note, and domain result separate. |
| Let a `U.MethodDescription` episteme, its described Method, a plan, option row, publication, or reader position perform Work. | State in ordinary language that an admitted System performs dated Work using the Method. Recover its A.13 core and independently admit the Work under A.15.1; add F.6 only when the present use needs precise assignment-bound attribution. Expand assignment and attribution detail only when that use needs it, attribution is ambiguous, or the source wording must be repaired. |
| Rank heterogeneous candidates under one hidden “depth” score. | Preserve direct kinds and compare only declared use-bearing dimensions without hidden scalarization. |

### C.19.2:9 - Consequences

The pattern makes cheap, truthful use a first-class result. Teams can apply one current method without ceremony, yet repeated or consequential uses can justify configuration or a real choice. The cost is naming the result, guarantee, applicable condition or predicate, and enough work economics to support the path. That bounded burden prevents apparatus display from replacing practical return.

### C.19.2:10 - Rationale

Application is the common job; selection is conditional. Starting from application preserves the frequent case in which a subject pattern is already selected and only the next useful adaptation matters. When alternatives are real, existing generation and choice patterns provide better result semantics than a fifth local decision vocabulary. Direct-kind discipline prevents an umbrella comparison word from becoming a new ontology.

The aphorism is: **make the apparatus earn its setup work.**

### C.19.2:11 - SoTA-Echoing

| Practice question | Current practice and source | FPF alignment | Disposition |
|---|---|---|---|
| How much reasoning effort repays its cost? | Resource-rational analysis ties computation to action value under bounded resources (Lieder & Griffiths 2020, with Russell & Wefald 1991 as lineage). | The useful-result threshold and non-dominated next move govern setup and application work. The repeated-handoff and one-off cases show the practical difference. | **Adapt.** FPF retains multiple separately defined dimensions rather than one universal value-of-computation scalar. |
| Should ontology/formality be complete before use? | Demand-driven incremental formalization starts from useful work and deepens when use repays it (Shipman & McCall 1999, still current as the named HCI/knowledge-base precursor). | The one-apparatus path allows value before total configuration, with reopen on recurrence, failure, automation, or stronger guarantee. | **Adopt as continuing lineage.** No HOS tool or single formality ladder is imported. |
| Do different questions warrant different apparatus and outputs? | Current competency-question work distinguishes purposes and expected products rather than imposing one ontology checklist (Keet & Khan 2024). | Eligibility is tied to one declared use/result/guarantee; the pattern does not universalize one method or checklist. | **Adapt.** Question differentiation changes candidate eligibility and return. |
| How should concern and purpose constrain a model or architecture description? | ISO/IEC/IEEE 42010:2022 keeps concerns, stakeholders, viewpoints, and architecture descriptions explicit without prescribing one tool. | Declared use, guarantee, and direct result keep apparatus application purpose-bound while subject patterns retain their kinds. | **Adapt.** Use the purpose/concern discipline without importing architecture-description ontology into every apparatus. |

These sources change the positive method: the user starts from a result, may obtain value before total configuration, opens choice only for a live set, and reopens when use economics or guarantee changes. They do not license prestige ranking, tool mandates, or a universal apparatus kind.

### C.19.2:12 - Relations

- **Coordinates with:** `C.39` for a missing explanation of how to obtain the result; `C.40` for feasible variation and examination; `C.18` for the generation account and archive/front stewardship; `C.19` for explore/exploit policy over still-live candidate pools; `C.19.1` for scale-amenable bearer preference; `C.22.1` for adaptation signatures; `E.23` for repeated improvement; and `C.31.ASAP` for architecture-scale preference.
- **Uses conditionally:** `C.11` only when an actual local-choice question over a live eligible set exists. It consumes, but does not extend, the four `ChoiceResult` dispositions.
- **Hands off enactment to:** `A.15.2` for work plans, `A.15.1` for dated work, and `C.24` only for tool-call enactment planning. The direct domain pattern contains the defining content for the practical result.
- **Description-level specialization:** `A.7.1` narrows the method claims stated here for consequence-guided ontology analysis. It retains the declared use, problem-facing result, claimed guarantee, horizon, useful threshold, separation among plan, Work, and result, stop, and reopen. It retains the candidate and choice branch only when that branch is actually triggered. This wording adds no relation occurrence between the described Methods and asserts neither `U.SubkindOf` nor a world relation.
- **Does not replace:** durable U-kind admission in `E.24`/`E.24.UK`, parsimony in `A.11`, evidence-use and assurance patterns, or any candidate's direct kind.
