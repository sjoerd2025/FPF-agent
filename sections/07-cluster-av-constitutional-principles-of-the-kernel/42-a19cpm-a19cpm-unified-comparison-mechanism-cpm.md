### A.19.CPM:0 - At a glance (didactic, informative)

CPM is the CHR comparison kernel: it compares two admitted profiles under an explicit, admissibility‑gated comparator and returns a **set‑valued** comparison outcome.

**One-screen purpose (manager-first).** CPM answers: "Given two admitted profiles and an explicit comparator, what relation holds under the declared admissibility frame?" It does **not** answer: "Which one should we pick?" (selection) nor "What is the score?" (scoring).

**Use this when.** Use CPM when the current project question is comparison under one declared comparator, not scoring, folding, selection, publication, or work authorization.

**What this buys.** The practitioner gets one set-valued comparison outcome that downstream selection can consume. The actual `Compare` application keeps the profile pair, comparator, claim scope and selected context slices, optional A.19 predicate, reference plane, evaluation window, policies, and output binding recoverable. Partial order, incomparability, missing evidence, and scale limits remain explicit instead of becoming a hidden scalar winner.

**First output.** Read the by-value set bound to `ComparisonResultSlot`: only the relation or poset tokens. Read comparator, comparison scope, predicate when used, plane, window, eligibility value, and evidence use from the actual operation application and their direct neighboring relations; they are not fields hidden inside the output.

**Manager quick checklist (before you trust a comparison):**
* **Comparator is explicit:** do we have a `ComparatorSpecRef`, and is it admitted by `CG‑Spec.ComparatorSet`?
* **Admissibility is declared:** do we cite `CG‑Spec` (and `SCP` when numeric ops exist) and treat violations as `degrade|abstain`?
* **Evidence is not faked:** are missing or unknown inputs treated as `degrade|abstain` under the effective MinimalEvidence policy (never as `pass`)?
* **Partiality is preserved:** are we willing to accept incomparability and ties as first‑class outcomes (set‑valued result), rather than forcing a winner?

* **Suite stage:** `compare` (pipeline order lives in `A.19.CHR:4.5`, not in the `mechanisms[]` enumeration).
* **Input (conceptual):** left profile, right profile, `CN-Spec`, `CG-Spec`, an explicit `ComparatorSpec`, one `U.ClaimScope` with selected A.2.6 `U.ContextSlice` members, an optional A.19 `CharacteristicSpacePredicate` when the comparison depends on one, effective reference plane, explicit evaluation window, and optional explicit `MinimalEvidence` override.
* **Output (conceptual):** the by-value `ComparisonResultSlot` set of relation or poset tokens. It is not a score, selected set, result episteme, work-result relation, evidence record, or container for replay metadata.
* **Planned slot fillings:** concrete `ComparatorSpecRef.edition` and policy ids are planned fillers only under the exact A.15.3 planned-filling declaration and are carried by `SlotFillingsPlanItem` rows (A.15.3 plus `A.19.CHR:4.7.2`). CPM's declaration does not fill project-specific slots. A dated comparison `U.Work` has separately governed occurrence-parameter bindings; an actual A.6.1 `Compare` operation application binds the set-valued result to `ComparisonResultSlot`; and its A.10 evidence-provenance path records the evidence and source-currentness basis used for replay.
* **Reproducible comparisons:** for parity and benchmark style runs that require a stable run package plus report record (editions, windows, parity pins), use `G.9` (Parity and Benchmark Harness). CPM stays kernel-only.
* **What CPM does not do (strict distinction):**

  * does **not** normalize (`UNM`);
  * does **not** choose indicators (`UINDM`);
  * does **not** score (`USCM`);
  * does **not** fold or aggregate (`ULSAM`);
  * does **not** select (“pick best”) — that is `SelectorMechanism`.
* **Core safety commitments:** admissibility gate via `CG-Spec.ComparatorSet` + `CG-Spec.SCP` + CSLC; tri-state admissibility (`pass|degrade|abstain`); unknown never coerces to “pass” or to a fabricated outcome; no silent scalarization or totalization.
* **Where method details live:** in editions of `ComparatorSpec` and their SoTA wiring (Part G packs and extensions), not inside CPM’s kernel semantics.
* **Quick rule of thumb:** if you need **numbers**, that’s `USCM`; if you need a **selection or selected-set result**, that’s `SelectorMechanism`. CPM’s job is only: **compare → relation tokens**.

### A.19.CPM:1 - Problem frame

FPF's Characterization (CHR) suite treats comparison as a **distinct** mechanism stage (`compare`) with suite‑wide obligations that forbid hidden scalarization or totalization, require tri‑state guards, and enforce admissibility declarations for numeric operations. Comparison must therefore be described as:

* a **mechanism** (in the `U.Mechanism.Intension` sense, per `A.6.1` and slot discipline `A.6.5`),
* that is **suite‑conformant** (per CHR obligations and protocol closure in `A.19.CHR`),
* and **governing-spec-ref-respecting** (comparability and admission are governed by `CN-Spec` and admissibility is gated by `CG-Spec` rather than re-invented locally).

Within suite protocols, CPM appears as the explicit `compare` stage: it consumes admitted left and right profiles, including scores and folded measures when those upstream stages are present, and produces an admissible, replayable comparison result that downstream selection can consume without CPM smuggling selection or scoring semantics into comparison.

### A.19.CPM:2 - Problem

Engineering teams frequently need to compare two options (designs, methods, vendors, trajectories, hypotheses, etc.) across multiple measures and under incomplete evidence. Without a canonical comparison mechanism, teams predictably fall into one or more of these failure modes:

* **Hidden scalarization:** forcing a single number (or a single winner) from multi‑criteria reality, erasing incomparability and ties.
* **Silent totalization:** inventing an implied total order by convenience tie‑breakers or implicit thresholds, even when only a partial order is warranted.
* **Inadmissible arithmetic:** comparing across measures using operations that are not scale-admissible (CSLC‑violating) or not admitted by the declared admissibility frame.
* **Comparator drift:** “the comparator” exists only as prose or code intuition; different teams compare the same option set and measure set differently because the comparator spec is not explicit and edition‑pinned.
* **Unknown coercion:** missing or unknown evidence is coerced into an outcome (e.g., `missing = equal`), producing comparisons that look decisive but are epistemically unsafe.
* **Comparison-boundary drift:** the same result label is reused after the profile pair, comparator, A.19 predicate, claim scope, selected context slices, reference plane, or evaluation window changed.
* **Cross-scheme or cross-plane leakage:** a comparison relies on a semantic relation between two exact F.17 `SchemeSenseCell` values without an obtaining F.9 `Bridge` and its separate bounded-use claim, or crosses exact ReferencePlanes without the applicable plane relation and policy. The relation or policy needed by the comparison is then unrecoverable.

CPM exists to make comparison explicit, admissibility-gated, set-valued, and replayable, so downstream selection can remain a separate policy-bound step.

### A.19.CPM:3 - Forces

1. **Usability vs correctness:** engineers want a "simple compare" function; correctness demands explicit admissibility, explicit comparator choice, and explicit handling of incomparability and unknown evidence.
2. **Total order convenience vs partial order truth:** total orders simplify downstream selection; partial orders are often the faithful representation (especially in multi‑criteria settings).
3. **Evolvability vs stability:** comparator methods evolve (SoTA churn); kernel semantics and slot field sets must remain stable and wiring‑friendly.
4. **Replayability vs speed of discussion:** teams want fast decisions; replay requires the dated comparison `U.Work`, the actual `Compare` operation application with exact edition, policy, argument, and result bindings, and an A.10 evidence-provenance path.
5. **Cross-scheme reasoning vs Bridge and ReferencePlane discipline:** a comparison that relies on a semantic relation between two exact F.17 `SchemeSenseCell` values requires an obtaining F.9 `Bridge` and a separate C.2.1 bounded-use claim; a plane-only crossing requires the applicable ReferencePlane relation and policy. Neither branch supplies scope, predicate, plane, or time from an umbrella context label.
6. **Avoiding “second centers of gravity”:** mechanism semantics must have a governing pattern; otherwise the suite, `A.6.1` archetypes, and Part‑G wiring drift apart.

### A.19.CPM:4 - Solution

CPM is specified as a canonical `U.Mechanism.Intension` whose core commitments are:

* **Comparator admissibility is declared and gated** (`CG-Spec.ComparatorSet`, and `CG-Spec.SCP` when numeric operations are involved; scale admissibility via CSLC).
* **Results are set‑valued relation or poset tokens**; partial orders remain partial; no silent scalarization or totalization.
* **Admissibility is tri‑state and fail‑closed** on missing admissibility and evidence; unknown never coerces into a fabricated outcome.
* **Comparison remains distinct from selection**; CPM produces relation outcomes; `SelectorMechanism` consumes them.

This pattern defines (governing-pattern, wiring‑friendly):
1. a **stable mechanism boundary** for admissible comparison: `Compare(...) → ComparisonResultSlot` plus a tri‑state `CompareEligibility` guard;
2. a **stable SlotKind field set** (by suite lexicon tokens) that downstream selection and Part‑G wiring can rely on without SlotKind drift;
3. an **admissibility and evidence responsibility split**: admissibility is gated by `CG-Spec` (and CSLC), while admission and comparability relations are cited from `CN-Spec`;
4. a minimal **replay basis**: dated comparison work, the effective refs and editions bound in the actual `Compare` operation application, its `ComparisonResultSlot` binding, and the A.10 evidence-provenance path needed to replay the comparison;
5. explicit **planned-filling separation**: `SlotFillingsPlanItem` rows carry planned edition and policy fillings; dated comparison `U.Work` remains the occurrence, the actual operation application carries argument and result bindings, and A.10 supplies the evidence-provenance path;
6. an explicit **comparison-use boundary**: claim scope, selected A.2.6 context slices, optional A.19 predicate, reference plane, and evaluation window are occurrence bindings, not generic context, comparator content, output fields, or an optional model-use structure.

#### A.19.CPM:4.1 - Mechanism.Intension (canonical; normative)

This is the canonical `U.Mechanism.Intension` for `CPM.IntensionRef`. It is intended to be cited by CHR suite publications and by any wiring layers.

* **Declaration boundary:** this A.6.1 mechanism intension declares `Compare` and `CompareEligibility`; it does not publish telemetry or create dated work, an actual operation application, comparison scope, result episteme, evidence use, provenance path, currentness relation, or publication relation. Each neighboring object or relation uses its direct governor.
  * **Planned slot fillings:** this intension does not fill project-specific slots for editions, policy ids, bridge ids, or similar pins. Planned fillers live in `SlotFillingsPlanItem` rows (A.15.3 plus `A.19.CHR:4.7.2`); dated comparison `U.Work` binds effective values as occurrence parameters.

* **IntensionHeader:** `id = CPM`, `version = 1.0.0`, `status = stable`.

* **IntensionRef:** `CPM.IntensionRef` designates this `U.Mechanism` episteme as the canonical suite member named in `A.19.CHR:4.2`; it is not the `EntityOfConcernRef` of the declared operation family.

* **SignatureManifest (optional; importability):** if a CPM publication is intended for reuse beyond the CHR suite, author SHOULD publish a `SignatureManifest` that records (i) the declared `Compare` stage‑op signature, (ii) the SlotKind field set (by lexicon tokens), and (iii) the explicit set‑valued output commitment (no silent scalarization or totalization).

* **Tell.** Lawful comparison producing **set‑valued** parity or poset outcomes (not a single scalar).

* **Purpose:** admissible comparison producing **set‑valued** parity or poset outcomes (not a single scalar).

* **Imports:** `G.0 (CG‑Spec.ComparatorSet, CG‑Spec.SCP, CG‑Spec.MinimalEvidence)`, `A.18 (CSLC)`, `A.19.CN (comparability and admission declarations)`, `A.19.CHR:4.2.1 (CHR SlotKind Lexicon)`.

* **EntityOfConcernRef:** the comparison operation family declared by `Compare` and `CompareEligibility` in this section.

* **Effective `U.ReferenceScheme`:** the CHR suite reference scheme in which the A.19.CHR SlotKind lexicon, CN-Spec, CG-Spec, and ComparatorSpec tokens are interpreted.

* **Direct signature components:**

  * **SubjectKind:** `Comparison`.
  * **RangedValueKind:** CHR-typed profile values in a CG-Frame (see `CG-Spec.ComparatorSet`).
  * **ResultKind:** `U.Set` of relation or poset tokens; the comparison result is set-valued by default.
  * **SliceSet:** `U.ContextSliceSet`.
  * **ExtentRule:** comparison ranges over admitted left and right profiles in one exact `U.ClaimScope`; selected `U.ContextSlice` values are members of that scope under A.2.6 and do not create a duplicate membership relation.

  These are direct A.6.0 declaration components. They do not form an additional comparison-content container, and they do not absorb comparator admission, evaluation, evidence-use, or replay relations.

* **SlotIndex** (derived projection from `SlotSpecs` and guard SlotSpecs; uses `A.19.CHR:4.2.1` SlotKind tokens; no independent semantics):

  * `LeftProfileSlot : ⟨ValueKind = U.Set (of U.Measure), refMode = ByValue⟩`,
  * `RightProfileSlot : ⟨ValueKind = U.Set (of U.Measure), refMode = ByValue⟩`,
  * `CNSpecSlot : ⟨ValueKind = CN‑Spec, refMode = CNSpecRef⟩`,
  * `CGSpecSlot : ⟨ValueKind = CG‑Spec, refMode = CGSpecRef⟩`,
  * `ComparatorSpecSlot : ⟨ValueKind = ComparatorSpec, refMode = ComparatorSpecRef⟩`,
  * `MinimalEvidenceSlot? : ⟨ValueKind = MinimalEvidence, refMode = MinimalEvidenceRef⟩` (optional override; otherwise cite `CGSpecSlot.MinimalEvidence`),
  * `ComparisonResultSlot : ⟨ValueKind = U.Set (relation or poset tokens), refMode = ByValue⟩`.

* **OperationAlgebra** (suite stage = `compare`, per `A.19.CHR:4.5`; canonical stage‑op = `Compare`):

  * `Compare(LeftProfileSlot, RightProfileSlot, CNSpecSlot, CGSpecSlot, ComparatorSpecSlot, MinimalEvidenceSlot?) → ComparisonResultSlot`.

* **Comparison-use bindings for each actual application** (required A.6.1 occurrence arguments; not CHR SlotKinds and not another container kind):

  * exact `U.ClaimScope` for the admitted profile pair and comparison claim;
  * selected `U.ContextSlice` members of that scope under A.2.6, without copying its membership relation;
  * optional by-value A.19 `CharacteristicSpacePredicate`, explicitly absent when comparison does not depend on one;
  * effective `U.ReferenceScheme` and reference plane; and
  * explicit comparison-evaluation point or interval.

  Together the profile pair and these bindings delimit the comparison scope. They do not form another U-kind, generic context input, model-use-structure field, or replay record. The comparator remains the separately declared `ComparatorSpecSlot`; evidence use retains its own A.2.4 claim scope and relevance window.

* **LawSet** (minimum; set-valued comparison, no hidden scalarization):

  1. **ComparatorSet gate:** `ComparatorSpecSlot` MUST be an element of `CGSpecSlot.ComparatorSet` (admissibility gate; cite `G.0`).
  2. **Set‑valued semantics:** `ComparisonResultSlot` is set‑valued (parity or poset tokens); partial orders remain partial — no silent totalization or scalarization.
  3. **CSLC+SCP admissibility:** any numeric ops implied by the comparator MUST be admissible under `CGSpecSlot.SCP` and CSLC-admissible (cite `G.0` + `A.18`).
  4. **Unknown is not coerced:** missing or unknown evidence MUST NOT be mapped to a comparison outcome; use tri‑state guards.
  5. **No hidden thresholds or tie-breakers:** any thresholds, epsilons, priority orders, or tie-break logic MUST live in the declared `ComparatorSpecSlot`, or in `CNSpecSlot.acceptance` as explicit acceptance clauses, and be edition-pinned for replay; CPM MUST NOT smuggle constants.
  6. **No implicit UNM:** CPM does not normalize or align internally. Normalization-based comparability requires already-normalized inputs plus exact upstream normalization refs; otherwise eligibility is `degrade` or `abstain`.
  7. **No silent boundary change:** a `Compare` application does not silently change its profile pair, `U.ClaimScope`, selected context slices, optional A.19 predicate, comparator, reference scheme or plane, or evaluation window. A changed binding is a different application and requires a newly evaluated outcome.

* **AdmissibilityConditions** (tri‑state guard; fail‑closed on missing admissibility and evidence):

  * `CompareEligibility(LeftProfileSlot, RightProfileSlot, CNSpecSlot, CGSpecSlot, ComparatorSpecSlot, MinimalEvidenceSlot?; comparison-use bindings) → GuardDecision ∈ {pass|degrade|abstain}`.
  * `pass` requires: (i) comparator admission; (ii) scale-admissible operations; (iii) admitted and comparable profiles under the exact claim scope and selected A.2.6 context slices; (iv) an explicit evaluation point or interval and reference plane; (v) the same by-value A.19 predicate when one is used; and (vi) satisfaction of the effective MinimalEvidence policy.
  * If `CNSpecSlot.comparability` is normalization‑based (compare‑on‑invariants), `pass` additionally requires that the inputs are already in the required invariant and normalization regime; CPM MUST NOT “make them comparable” by silent normalization.
  * If `MinimalEvidenceSlot` is absent, the guard MUST evaluate evidence against `CGSpecSlot.MinimalEvidence` (by explicit rule), and MUST NOT return `pass` when evidence is missing or unknown **or** fails the effective MinimalEvidence gate.

* **Applicability:**

  * Intended for the CHR stage `compare`: it may follow indicatorization or scoring and optional folding when those stages are present, and it precedes selection wherever selection occurs. It remains distinct from selection.
  * Applicable only when `CGSpecSlot` supplies the current admissibility and evidence-policy declarations. Missing declarations fail closed.
  * Inside the CHR suite, `A.19.CHR:4.5` alone determines stage ordering and optionality; CPM does not infer order from `mechanisms[]`.
  * Every actual comparison binds one exact `U.ClaimScope`, selected A.2.6 `U.ContextSlice` members, optional A.19 predicate, effective reference plane, and explicit evaluation point or interval. There is no implicit latest value and no default window inherited from the predicate.
  * When a comparison relies on a semantic relation between two exact F.17 `SchemeSenseCell` values, test the F.9 `BridgePredicateProfile`, cite the Bridge only when its direct predicate obtains, and state a separate C.2.1 bounded-use claim. If the predicate is false or unresolved and that semantic relation is required, `CompareEligibility` cannot be `pass`; follow the declared `degrade` policy when applicable, otherwise `abstain`. A plane-only crossing instead cites the applicable ReferencePlane relation and policy. If both facts are current, state both under their own predicates. Neither branch supplies claim scope, selected slices, predicate, comparator, or evaluation time.

* **Neighboring F.9 Bridge, C.2.1 bounded-use claim, and ReferencePlane relation and policy:**

  When profiles require interpretation across different semantic contexts, resolve the two exact F.17 `SchemeSenseCell` endpoints and test one F.9 `BridgePredicateProfile`. For an obtaining Bridge, state its exact endpoints and profile separately, then state suitability for the named comparison use in a C.2.1 assertion whose EntityOfConcern is that Bridge and whose ClaimGraph carries `<u,d,r,t>` and polarity. Include `CL` or an observed-loss note only when the receiving use consumes it; permitted loss remains `t` in the bounded-use claim. For a ReferencePlane crossing, cite the applicable plane relation and policy separately. Open A.10 only when bounded reliance is current and B.3 only when an actual named assurance claim is current. If that assurance argument consumes a locally declared `R_eff` calculation, cite its applicable domain model and calculation; neither the Bridge nor `CL` creates a penalty. Adding or changing any of these neighboring facts does not by itself change the CPM declaration.

* **Neighboring dated work, operation application, result binding, and evidence relations:**

  A dated comparison run is `A.15.1 U.Work`. Its actual A.6.1 `Compare` application binds the profile pair, comparator, comparison-use arguments, policies, and set-valued `ComparisonResultSlot`. A.2.4 separately governs evidence use with its own evidence claim scope and relevance window; A.10 governs the evidence-provenance path and local `RelianceDisposition` for the same bounded use; G.11 governs source or assertion-edition currentness. A durable result episteme, when needed, is governed by C.2.1, and any current entity-identity inception claim by A.15.PROD. No universal work-result or comparison-result relation is presumed. To replay the comparison, recover:

  * the two profile values or exact upstream refs, one `U.ClaimScope`, selected A.2.6 context slices, optional A.19 predicate, effective reference scheme and plane, and evaluation point or interval;
  * `CNSpecRef.edition`, `CGSpecRef.edition`, and the effective `ComparatorSpecRef`;
  * the effective MinimalEvidence policy, either the explicit override or `CGSpecSlot.MinimalEvidence`;
  * the realized `GuardDecision` and, for `degrade` or `abstain`, any current downstream-handling policy;
  * the effective upstream normalization dependency, or the explicit absence that caused degradation or abstention;
  * the comparison result; any obtaining F.9 `Bridge` and separate C.2.1 bounded-use-claim refs actually consumed by this occurrence; any optional `CL` or observed-loss-note ref actually used; any applicable ReferencePlane relation and policy refs; and, only when the comparison consumes an actual named assurance claim, that claim's B.3 `AssuranceResult` and declared domain-model and calculation refs.

  Use G.9 when a parity or benchmark use requires a stable run package and report record. These neighboring records support replay; none is CPM declaration content.

#### A.19.CPM:4.2 - Interpretation notes — informative

* **The output is a value, not a replay container.** The by-value set bound to `ComparisonResultSlot` contains relation or poset tokens only. Comparator, scope, predicate, plane, window, eligibility, evidence use, provenance, and currentness remain separate bindings or relations.
* **Set-valued output is the default, not a loophole.** “Set‑valued” means CPM preserves incomparability, ties, and partiality as first‑class outcomes; it does not authorize silent post‑processing into a scalar or a single winner.
* **Total orders are allowed only if declared by the comparator.** If a `ComparatorSpec` defines a total order, CPM still outputs a (singleton) set of relation tokens; the totalization is a property of the declared comparator, not an implicit kernel default.
* **Normalization is not smuggled into comparison.** If `CN‑Spec.comparability` declares normalization‑based invariants for comparison, that dependence must be represented explicitly via the suite protocol and, where needed, explicit Uses contours (CPM consumes admitted profiles; it does not silently normalize them).
* **Thresholds and tie-breakers are never kernel constants.** If thresholds exist, they belong to explicit policies or specs such as `ComparatorSpec` and `AcceptanceClauses`, are edition-pinned, and are recorded by the dated comparison occurrence for replay.

### A.19.CPM:5 - Archetypal Grounding — informative

#### A.19.CPM:5.1 - Tell

Think of CPM as a declaration for a **replayable, relation-producing comparison operation**:

* Input: "two admitted profiles + an explicit comparator spec + declared admissibility and evidence declarations"
* Output: “a **set‑valued** relation outcome that preserves incomparability and uncertainty”

The key didactic boundary is: **CPM compares; it does not decide.**

#### A.19.CPM:5.2 - Show (U.System) — comparing two supplier options without faking a total order

A program manager compares Supplier‑A vs Supplier‑B for a safety‑critical component. The team tracks a profile of measures (cost, lead time, defect rate, assurance, sustainability), but not all measures are strictly comparable across regions (different reporting regimes, different units).

* The project has a declared `CN‑Spec` (admission and comparability declarations) and a declared `CG‑Spec` that lists admissible comparators in `ComparatorSet` and evidence rules in `MinimalEvidence`.
* The comparator is `ParetoDominanceComparatorSpecRef@edition`, declared in `CG-Spec.ComparatorSet`.
* The actual application binds the two supplier profiles; the claim scope `supplier options for the named component and procurement decision`; its selected regulatory and reporting `U.ContextSlice` members under A.2.6; `ComparisonPredicate = none` because Pareto dominance is supplied by the comparator; the stated procurement reference plane; and the explicit comparison interval.
* CPM runs `Compare(...)`; a changed component, scope member, comparator, plane, or interval is another comparison rather than an update to the same output.

  * If Supplier‑A is better in cost but worse in defect rate and incomparable on assurance due to missing evidence, CPM does **not** invent “A wins” or “A loses”.
  * `CompareEligibility` returns `degrade` or `abstain` under the evidence policy. On `abstain`, no comparison tokens are fabricated. When an explicit `degrade` policy permits a bounded partial comparison, `ComparisonResultSlot` contains only the justified relation tokens and preserves incomparability.
* The downstream `SelectorMechanism` can then return a selected set (e.g., keep both suppliers in the candidate set) rather than forcing a single winner by hidden tie‑break rules.

#### A.19.CPM:5.3 - Show (U.Episteme) — uncertainty‑aware comparison with set‑valued outcomes

A research lead compares two proposed methods for a system component. Both methods have performance estimates with uncertainty bounds (e.g., distributions or prediction intervals). The team uses a SoTA uncertainty quantification package (post‑2015 conformal families are a common example) to avoid overstating confidence.

* `USCM` produces score profiles that are interval‑valued (or otherwise uncertainty‑annotated) rather than point estimates.
* The chosen comparator is uncertainty‑aware and declared as a `ComparatorSpec` (edition‑pinned) in `CG‑Spec.ComparatorSet`.
* `CompareEligibility` returns its guard value separately. If comparison proceeds, CPM returns justified relation tokens such as `not worse` or `incomparable`; if it abstains, no `abstain` token is smuggled into `ComparisonResultSlot`.
* The dated comparison `U.Work`, actual `Compare` application with its effective comparator, evidence-policy, and `ComparisonResultSlot` bindings, and A.10 evidence-provenance path let later readers reproduce why the comparison abstained or degraded instead of mistaking missing evidence for equality.

### A.19.CPM:6 - Bias-Annotation — informative

CPM is a comparison *kernel*; it does not remove bias by itself, but it prevents the most common bias‑amplifying failure modes (hidden thresholds, hidden tie‑breakers, unknown coercion).

Typical bias risks and mitigations:

* **Comparator choice encodes value judgments.** Weights, priority orders, thresholds, and “tie‑break” conventions can encode organizational bias. CPM forces these to live in explicit, edition‑pinned `ComparatorSpec` records or policy records rather than in invisible code or informal reasoning.
* **Missing evidence is rarely random.** If evidence is systematically missing for certain contexts or groups, naive “unknown → worse” is a bias amplifier. CPM’s tri‑state guard avoids coercion; but teams must still define policy‑bound failure behavior and be explicit when abstention is acceptable.
* **Cross-scheme comparisons can embed structural unfairness.** A comparison that relies on a semantic relation between two exact F.17 `SchemeSenseCell` values cites the obtaining F.9 `Bridge` and its separate bounded-use claim; together they expose the tested correspondence or difference and tolerated loss. A plane-only crossing cites the applicable ReferencePlane relation and policy. Neither branch replaces comparison scope, predicate, comparator, or time.
* **Overconfidence via scalarization.** Collapsing partial orders into scalars often overstates certainty and hides tradeoffs. CPM makes set‑valued outcomes first‑class, so the human or managerial decision can remain honest about tradeoffs.

### A.19.CPM:7 - Conformance Checklist

A CPM publication or use is conformant if it satisfies the checks below together with the A.6.1 mechanism conformance checklist and the CHR suite obligations in `A.19.CHR:4.3`:

| Check Id | Requirement (normative) | Notes (didactic and evidence) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **CC-A19CPM-0** | **Mechanism declaration completeness.** One `U.Mechanism` episteme, its exact comparison-operation-family `EntityOfConcernRef`, effective `U.ReferenceScheme`, direct signature components, SlotSpecs, `OperationAlgebra`, `LawSet`, `AdmissibilityConditions`, Applicability, and optional `SignatureManifest` are recoverable. | An obtaining F.9 `Bridge`, its separate C.2.1 bounded-use claim when consumed, any applicable ReferencePlane relation and policy, dated `U.Work`, actual operation application and result binding, any result episteme, A.10 evidence-provenance, G.11 currentness, and G.9 parity objects remain separate. |
| **CC‑A19CPM‑1** | **Single governing pattern.** The canonical CPM intension is governed here (`A.19.CPM:4.1`); other descriptions cite this section rather than restating the kernel law. | Prevents near-duplicate comparison semantics from drifting. |
| **CC‑A19CPM‑2** | **Suite stage alignment.** `Compare` is the canonical stage‑op for CHR stage `compare`; ordering and optionality are taken only from `A.19.CHR:4.5`. | Never infer order from `mechanisms[]`. |
| **CC‑A19CPM‑3** | **SlotKind discipline.** SlotKind tokens follow the suite lexicon (`A.19.CHR:4.2.1`). | No SlotKind drift across specializations and wiring. |
| **CC‑A19CPM‑4** | **Comparator admissibility gate.** `ComparatorSpecSlot ∈ CGSpecSlot.ComparatorSet` is enforced (fail-closed otherwise). | Admissibility is declared, not improvised. |
| **CC‑A19CPM‑5** | **Scale admissibility.** Any numeric operations implied by the comparator are admissible under `CGSpecSlot.SCP` and CSLC-admissible. | “Weighted sum” etc must be explicitly admissible. |
| **CC‑A19CPM‑6** | **Set‑valued semantics.** Outputs remain set‑valued; no silent scalarization or totalization is introduced. | Incomparability and ties are first‑class outcomes. |
| **CC‑A19CPM‑7** | **Tri‑state admissibility (fail‑closed).** `CompareEligibility(...) → {pass|degrade|abstain}` exists and does not return `pass` on missing admissibility and evidence. | Unknown never coerces to `pass`. |
| **CC‑A19CPM‑8** | **MinimalEvidence defaulting is explicit.** If `MinimalEvidenceSlot?` is absent, the effective evidence policy is `CGSpecSlot.MinimalEvidence` by explicit rule. | Avoid “implicit evidence policy.” |
| **CC‑A19CPM‑9** | **Gate and guard separation + lexeme discipline.** CPM does not publish `GateDecision` nor `DecisionLog`; mechanism predicates use `…Eligibility` (not reserved gate `…Guard`). | Aligns with suite obligations (`gate_decision_separation`, `guard_lexeme_reservations`). |
| **CC-A19CPM-10** | **Bridge and reference-plane discipline.** A comparison that relies on a semantic relation between two exact F.17 `SchemeSenseCell` values cites an obtaining F.9 `Bridge` under a satisfied `BridgePredicateProfile` and a separate C.2.1 bounded-use claim; a plane-only crossing cites the applicable ReferencePlane relation and policy; both are stated when both facts are current. | `CL` is optional. CPM supplies no default assurance penalty, fold, or `R_eff`; a local `R_eff` is admissible only for an actual named assurance claim under its declared domain model and calculation. These neighboring facts are not CPM declaration content. |
| **CC-A19CPM-11** | **Replay basis completeness.** Dated comparison `U.Work`, the actual `Compare` application, its profile, comparator, `U.ClaimScope`, selected A.2.6 context-slice, optional A.19 predicate, reference-plane, evaluation-window, policy, and `ComparisonResultSlot` bindings, plus direct evidence-use, provenance, and currentness relations, are recoverable. | The output value does not carry this metadata. |
| **CC-A19CPM-12** | **Planned-filling separation.** Editions and policy ids are planned fillings only in `SlotFillingsPlanItem` rows; the CPM declaration does not fill them, dated comparison `U.Work` remains the occurrence, and the actual operation application carries effective argument and result bindings. | Planned baseline = A.15.3 plus suite PlanItem; A.6.1 governs operation application; A.10 supplies evidence provenance when relied on. |
| **CC-A19CPM-13** | **No implicit UNM.** CPM never performs silent normalization; normalization-based comparability requires explicit upstream UNM refs or returns `abstain` or `degrade`. | Keeps compare-on-invariants explicit. |
| **CC-A19CPM-14** | **Comparison-scope completeness.** Every actual application binds one exact profile pair, `U.ClaimScope`, selected A.2.6 context slices, optional A.19 predicate, effective reference scheme and plane, and explicit evaluation point or interval. | No generic context input, optional model-use structure, or label supplies these values. |
| **CC-A19CPM-15** | **Outcome separation.** `ComparisonResultSlot` contains only the by-value set of relation or poset tokens; `GuardDecision` remains the separate eligibility value, and abstention fabricates no output token. | Comparator, scope, plane, window, evidence, provenance, currentness, result episteme, and selection remain separate. |
| **CC-A19CPM-16** | **No generic result relation.** The actual A.6.1 operation application binds the output; C.2.1 governs a durable result episteme when needed; direct subject patterns govern any other result relation. | CPM mints no universal comparison-result or work-result link. |

### A.19.CPM:8 - Common Anti‑Patterns and How to Avoid Them

* **Anti‑pattern: “Comparison returns a score.”**
  *Symptom:* `Compare(x,y)` returns a numeric margin or a single rank position.
  *Avoid:* keep numeric scoring in `USCM`; CPM returns relation tokens (set‑valued). If a numeric comparator is desired, it must be an explicit `ComparatorSpec` and still yields relation tokens as the kernel output.

* **Anti‑pattern: “CPM picks the winner.”**
  *Symptom:* comparison logic embeds winner selection or selected-set truncation.
  *Avoid:* CPM only compares; selection is `SelectorMechanism`, which consumes comparison outcomes and remains policy‑bound.

* **Anti‑pattern: “Comparator by prose or code default.”**
  *Symptom:* comparator choice is implicit (e.g., “we usually do lexicographic by safety then cost”), not edition‑pinned.
  *Avoid:* require an explicit `ComparatorSpecRef` from `CG-Spec.ComparatorSet`; dated comparison `U.Work` binds the effective edition as an occurrence parameter, and A.10 supplies its evidence-provenance path.

* **Anti‑pattern: “GateDecision leakage.”**
  *Symptom:* the `compare` step emits or assumes GateDecision, GateLog, or DecisionLog records as part of suite closure, or uses reserved gate‑lexemes (`…Guard`) for mechanism‑level predicates.
  *Avoid:* keep `CompareEligibility` as the mechanism-level tri-state predicate and assign gate decisions to their governing pattern. Keep dated comparison `U.Work`, the actual `Compare` operation application and its result binding, any result episteme, A.10 evidence-provenance, G.11 currentness, and publication relations separate from CPM declaration content.

* **Anti‑pattern: “SlotKind drift.”**
  *Symptom:* renaming or re‑purposing `LeftProfileSlot`, `RightProfileSlot`, `ComparatorSpecSlot`, or `ComparisonResultSlot` across specializations or across CHR layers.
  *Avoid:* use the suite SlotKind lexicon (`A.19.CHR:4.2.1`) and keep SlotIndex as a derived projection.

* **Anti‑pattern: “Smuggling plan‑binding into CPM.”**
  *Symptom:* hard‑coding comparator editions, policy ids, or “launch values” inside the CPM intension or pattern prose.
  *Avoid:* put edition and policy fillers only in `SlotFillingsPlanItem` rows; dated comparison `U.Work` binds effective refs as occurrence parameters, and A.10 supplies the evidence-provenance path.

* **Anti‑pattern: “Tie‑breakers as hidden constants.”**
  *Symptom:* forced total order via untracked thresholds, epsilons, or “if equal then compare cost” logic.
  *Avoid:* make tie-break policy part of explicit comparator and acceptance policies, pin their editions, and record their effective use in the dated comparison occurrence.

* **Anti‑pattern: “Unknown coerces to outcome.”**
  *Symptom:* missing evidence treated as equal, zero, or worse, producing decisive comparisons from absent information.
  *Avoid:* tri‑state guard; fail‑closed on missing evidence; explicit failure behavior via evidence policy.

* **Anti-pattern: `ComparisonResultSlot` as a replay record.**
  *Symptom:* comparator, scope, predicate, window, evidence, or currentness fields are placed inside the set-valued output.
  *Avoid:* keep the output to relation or poset tokens; recover effective arguments from the actual operation application and direct neighboring relations.

* **Anti-pattern: Using one F.9 Bridge rule for both semantic and ReferencePlane crossings.**
  *Symptom:* an F.9 Bridge is required merely because reference schemes or planes differ; the separate C.2.1 bounded-use claim is absent; or `CL` and a bare `R_eff` penalty are treated as mandatory.
  *Avoid:* cite an obtaining F.9 Bridge and separate bounded-use claim only for the semantic branch; cite the applicable ReferencePlane relation and policy for the plane branch; state both when both facts are current. Make only actually consumed refs recoverable with the dated `U.Work` and actual `Compare` application. Add `CL` only when needed. Open B.3 only for an actual named assurance claim, and use a local `R_eff` only if its declared domain model and calculation define it. Use A.10 for evidence provenance and ordinary bounded reliance, not to establish either crossing relation.

### A.19.CPM:9 - Consequences

* **Improved usability (didactic):** CPM gives a single, engineer‑readable place to learn “what admissible comparison means” and what it does *not* mean.
* **Higher replayability:** comparison results remain traceable through dated comparison `U.Work`, the actual `Compare` application and its `ComparisonResultSlot` binding, the A.10 evidence-provenance path, any consumed obtaining F.9 `Bridge` with its separate bounded-use claim, and any applicable ReferencePlane relation and policy.
* **Reduced semantic drift:** teams cannot silently shift from Pareto to lexicographic to “weighted sum” without changing explicit comparator specs and pins.
* **Explicit tradeoffs:** set‑valued outcomes force downstream reasoning to acknowledge incomparability and uncertainty rather than hiding them.
* **Cost:** downstream consumers (notably selection) must handle sets, abstentions, and partial orders explicitly. This is intentional: it moves complexity from hidden heuristics into explicit policy‑bound mechanisms.

### A.19.CPM:10 - Rationale

1. **Set‑valued by design:** partial orders are common in multi‑criteria settings; pretending they are total creates false certainty and brittle decisions.
2. **ComparatorSet gating:** declaring which comparisons are admissible, and under what scale or evidence rules, prevents “algorithm by convenience”.
3. **Tri‑state guards:** explicit `pass|degrade|abstain` preserves epistemic honesty: unknown is not silently converted into an outcome.
4. **Strict distinction:** separating compare from score and select prevents hidden semantic coupling and improves evolvability (methods change via wiring; kernel stays stable).
5. **Single governing pattern:** keeping one governing pattern eliminates near-duplicate comparison descriptions that drift apart and destroy usability.

### A.19.CPM:11 - SoTA-Echoing

**SoTA vs popular note.** This section records alignment to post‑2015 evidence‑backed practice. It is **not** a mandate to use fashionable methods; method semantics stay in SoTA packs (`G.2`) and wiring modules, while this pattern fixes the stable CPM mechanism boundary.

Concrete comparator-family SoTA packages are cited through their current Part G pack or claim sheet when one governs the use. CPM's kernel semantics remain unchanged.

| SoTA practice pointer (post‑2015)                                                                                                   | How it connects to CPM                                                                                                                                           | Adoption status in FPF                                                                                                |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Fair ranking and constrained ranking** (e.g., Zehlike et al., 2017; Biega et al., 2018)                                             | Reinforces the “no hidden tie‑breaks and thresholds” stance: fairness constraints belong in explicit comparator and acceptance policies, not as silent kernel constants. | Integrate via `ComparatorSpec` editions in `CG‑Spec.ComparatorSet` + policy pins; CPM remains unchanged.              |
| **Uncertainty-aware and set-valued inference** (e.g., Romano et al., 2019; Barber et al., 2021)                                       | Supports “comparison may abstain” and “set‑valued outcomes are honest”: uncertain profiles should not be coerced into point‑comparisons.                         | Model as comparator families (or supporting method families) packaged in `G.2`; wired into declared `ComparatorSpec`. |
| **Differentiable sorting and learned comparators** (e.g., Grover et al., 2019; Blondel et al., 2020) | When comparators are learned, explicit comparator specs, edition and policy bindings in the actual operation application, its `ComparisonResultSlot` binding, and A.10 evidence-provenance become even more important for replay and drift control. | Treated as method implementations behind `ComparatorSpec` (wiring-only in Part G); CPM kernel stays stable. |
| **Robust multi‑criteria decision support under partial orders** (modern robust outranking and preference-learning variants post‑2015) | Emphasizes preserving incomparability and explicitly encoding thresholds and preferences as declared artifacts.                                                      | Packaged as comparator families; admissibility and evidence remain gated by `CG‑Spec`.                                     |

#### A.19.CPM:11.1 - Currentness and smallest reopen rule

**Qualification basis and window.** The stable kernel claim is qualified by the current editions of A.6.1/A.6.5 operation and slot discipline, A.19/A.18 space and scale semantics, A.19.CN comparability, G.0 comparator and evidence admissibility, A.2.6 scope semantics, and the exact current G.2 comparator pack or claim sheet cited by an actual use. For that use, the effective qualification window is the intersection of those bound editions' currentness and any validity interval declared by the comparator pack or claim sheet; `post-2015` is an orientation label, not an indefinite freshness claim.

**Reopen the CPM kernel only when.** Reopen the smallest affected CPM rule when a direct governor changes binary `Compare` application identity or bindings, `ComparisonResultSlot` kind, comparator admission, scale or normalization admissibility, tri-state eligibility, comparison scope, or the separation of output, evidence, provenance, and result epistemes, or when qualified evidence contradicts one of those kernel commitments. A new algorithm family, learned model, fairness constraint, uncertainty method, threshold, or robustness technique that still satisfies those commitments changes its G.2 pack, `ComparatorSpec`, `CG-Spec`, or policy binding rather than CPM.

**Smallest affected locus.** A signature or result-kind change reopens only the corresponding direct-signature, SlotSpec, or `OperationAlgebra` passage in `A.19.CPM:4.1`; an admissibility or failure-semantics change reopens the matching `LawSet` or `AdmissibilityConditions` clause. Update only the nearest exercising case in `A.19.CPM:5.2` or `:5.3` and the corresponding `CC-A19CPM` row. Source-family churn that changes no kernel commitment updates the direct pack or claim sheet and, when its summary is stale, only the affected row in this SoTA map.
