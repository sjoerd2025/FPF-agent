### A.19.UINDM:0 - At a glance (didactic, informative)

* **Suite stage:** `indicatorize` (ordering lives only in `A.19.CHR:suite_protocols`).
* **Inputs (conceptual):** exact `U.CharacteristicSpaceRef`, `CNSpecRef`, and `IndicatorChoicePolicyRef`, with the bearer, claim scope and selected slices, qualification window, evidence basis, and intended use declared by those editions; when the selected policy is evidence-gated, also supply `CGSpecRef` and, optionally, a `MinimalEvidenceRef` override.
* **Output:** `IndicatorSetSlot` = a set of `U.CharacteristicRef` (chosen coordinates), not measurements.
* **Non‑goals:** does **not** normalize, score, compare, aggregate, threshold, publish, or emit telemetry; it only selects a subset under explicit policy.
* **P2W seam:** concrete edition/policy pins are bound in planned baseline plan items (`A.15.3` + `A.19.CHR:4.7.2`); executions only record effective refs/pins in `Audit`.
* **Failure mode:** tri‑state guard (`pass|degrade|abstain`); unknown never coerces to `pass`.
* **Quick rule of thumb:** if `CN‑Spec.indicator_policy` is absent → `IndicatorizeEligibility = abstain` (fail‑closed); if the selected policy is evidence‑gated → `CGSpecRef` MUST be available and the effective MinimalEvidence MUST be explicit (override or `CG‑Spec.MinimalEvidence`).

### A.19.UINDM:1 - Problem frame

FPF’s Characterization (CHR) suite treats indicatorization as a **distinct mechanism boundary** within the CHR suite (authoritative membership: `A.19.CHR:4.2`).
Suite membership is a **set** (order has no semantics); any intended ordering is expressed only via `suite_protocols` (`A.19.CHR:4.5`), under the suite obligations (`A.19.CHR:4.3`).

Within the canonical suite‑closed protocol, UINDM appears as the `indicatorize` stage (after `normalize`, before `score/compare/select`; optional stages remain explicitly optional per `suite_protocols`).

UINDM’s job is concept‑level and governed by CN‑Spec and CG‑Spec: it selects an **indicator subset** over an existing `U.CharacteristicSpace` under `CN‑Spec.indicator_policy`, using the suite-wide SlotKind lexicon to prevent SlotKind drift across the CHR mechanism chain and across SoTA wiring modules.
A “subspace view” (if needed) is treated as a **derived support view** over the chosen set (see `A.19.UINDM:4.2`), not as an extra mandatory output of the kernel signature.

### A.19.UINDM:2 - Problem

Engineering teams routinely need to decide “which characteristics count as indicators” for a CN‑frame—before they can score, compare, aggregate, or select. If indicatorization is not given a **first‑class mechanism boundary**, several failure modes emerge:

* **Hidden indicatorization:** downstream mechanisms (scoring/comparison/selection) implicitly decide which characteristics matter, making the CHR pipeline opaque and hard to audit.
* **NCV conflation:** measurability (or “having an NCV”) is treated as sufficient to be an indicator, collapsing the crucial distinction between “measurable characteristic” and “indicator chosen under policy.”
* **Drift and non-determinism:** indicator sets vary between teams, bearer classes, source or corpus editions, windows, and intended uses without stable policy and basis pins, making comparisons and decisions irreproducible.
* **Silent evidence coercion:** missing/unknown evidence is implicitly treated as acceptable (“pass”) or collapsed to an empty set, degrading decision quality without visibility.

### A.19.UINDM:3 - Forces

1. **Policy primacy vs method freedom.** Indicatorization must be governed by explicit `IndicatorChoicePolicy`, while still allowing multiple method families (e.g., theory‑first, invariance‑driven, evidence‑gated) to be wired later without mutating the mechanism’s signature.

2. **Selection‑only vs “semantic alchemy.”** UINDM must not smuggle normalization, scaling, polarity flips, aggregation, or scoring inside “indicator choice.” It is a selection mechanism over the declared characteristic-space basis, not a transformation mechanism.

3. **Declared-use locality vs reuse.** An indicator set is valid for its characteristic-space and CN-Spec editions, bearer, scope and window, evidence basis, policy, and intended use; a later use must recheck those premises and cite any source-local, kind, or plane relation it actually relies on.

4. **Auditability vs authoring overhead.** Engineer‑managers need to see *why* an indicator set was chosen and *which editions/policies* were in effect, but FPF stays conceptual (no data governance, no tool‑enforced metadata). Audit obligations must therefore be minimal yet decisive.

5. **Evolvability vs didactic usability.** CHR mechanisms must remain evolvable (stable slot lexicon; method specifics in SoTA packs / wiring), while the spec must remain teachable: a reader should find UINDM’s purpose, boundary, laws, guard behavior, and audit obligations in one place.

6. **Fail‑closed discipline.** Unknown/insufficient evidence must never be coerced into “pass”; tri‑state guards (`pass|degrade|abstain`) are required to preserve correctness under uncertainty.

7. **P2W separation and gate/guard separation.** UINDM must expose eligibility and audit pins without turning into (i) a WorkPlanning baseline binder or (ii) an admissibility gate:
   planned slot fillings belong to WorkPlanning plan items, while GateDecision/GateLog live in gate patterns / WorkEnactment (suite protocols remain mechanism‑steps only).

### A.19.UINDM:4 - Solution

UINDM is the **canonical indicatorization mechanism** in the CHR suite. It defines:

* a stable **mechanism boundary** (“indicatorize” is a stage with its own operation and eligibility predicate),
* a stable **SlotKind surface** (via the suite lexicon),
* a strict **selection‑only law set** (no implicit UNM; no unit, scale, or polarity changes),
* a **tri‑state admissibility guard** (fail‑closed on missing policy, admissibility, or evidence), and
* an **audit minimum** (the exact editions, bearer, scope and window, evidence basis, intended use, and any relation actually used).

UINDM also preserves the CHR suite obligations by construction: it does not embed GateDecision/GateLog, it does not perform publish/telemetry steps, and it records relation pins only when a receiving use actually depends on an obtaining relation.

Method semantics (“how to pick indicators”) remain out of suite core: they belong in SoTA packs (`G.2`) and wiring‑only extension modules (`GPatternExtension` blocks), while UINDM remains the stable mechanism boundary.

#### A.19.UINDM:4.1 - Mechanism.Intension (normative)

This is the canonical `U.Mechanism.Intension` for `UINDM.IntensionRef` and is intended to be cited by CHR suite publications and by any wiring layers.

* **Scope note:** this intension is an **instance** authored to the `U.Mechanism.Intension` shape governed by `A.6.1`. It defines only the mechanism’s semantic surface (slots/ops/laws/guards/audit). It does **not** bind project‑specific pins (P2W), and it does **not** emit GateDecision/GateLog; it emits `Audit` pins and a tri‑state guard only.
* **IntensionHeader:** `id = UINDM`, `version = 1.0.0`, `status = stable`.
* **IntensionRef:** `UINDM.IntensionRef` (canonical target for the suite member named in `A.19.CHR:4.2`).
* **Tell.** Policy‑bound indicatorization: select an indicator subset over an existing `U.CharacteristicSpace` under `CN‑Spec.indicator_policy`.
* **Purpose:** freeze a policy‑bound indicator subset early so downstream CHR mechanisms can assume a declared indicator profile (or explicitly `degrade/abstain`) rather than silently “choosing indicators” inside scoring/comparison/selection.
* **Imports:** `A.19.CN (CN‑Spec.indicator_policy)`, `A.6.5 (slot discipline)`, `A.19.CHR:4.2.1 (CHR SlotKind Lexicon)`, and (when evidence‑gated) `G.0 (CG‑Spec.MinimalEvidence)`.
* **SubjectBlock:**

  * **SubjectKind:** `Indicatorization`.
  * **GovernedValueDomain:** `U.CharacteristicSpace`.
  * **SliceBasis:** the declared `U.ClaimScope` and its selected `U.ContextSlice` members, together with the qualification window and intended use.
  * **ExtentRule:** indicatorization ranges over the declared characteristic-space basis `CNSpecSlot.cs_basis` (within `CNSpecSlot.chart`) for the exact bearer, claim scope and selected slices, qualification window, evidence basis, and intended use; it never enlarges that basis.
  * **ResultKind?:** `U.Set`.
* **SlotIndex** (derived projection from `SlotSpecs` / guard SlotSpecs; uses `A.19.CHR:4.2.1` SlotKind tokens; no independent semantics):

  * `CharacteristicSpaceSlot : ⟨ValueKind = U.CharacteristicSpace, refMode = CharacteristicSpaceRef⟩`,
  * `CNSpecSlot : ⟨ValueKind = CN‑Spec, refMode = CNSpecRef⟩`,
  * `IndicatorChoicePolicySlot : ⟨ValueKind = IndicatorChoicePolicy, refMode = IndicatorChoicePolicyRef⟩`,
  * no generic `ContextSlot`: `CNSpecSlot` and `IndicatorChoicePolicySlot` resolve the exact bearer, claim scope and selected slices, qualification window, evidence basis, and intended use,
  * `CGSpecSlot? : ⟨ValueKind = CG‑Spec, refMode = CGSpecRef⟩` (optional; REQUIRED iff the chosen `IndicatorChoicePolicy` is evidence‑gated),
  * `MinimalEvidenceSlot? : ⟨ValueKind = MinimalEvidence, refMode = MinimalEvidenceRef⟩` (optional override; if evidence‑gated and omitted, the effective MinimalEvidence is `CGSpecSlot.MinimalEvidence`),
  * `IndicatorSetSlot : ⟨ValueKind = U.Set (of U.CharacteristicRef), refMode = ByValue⟩`.
* **OperationAlgebra** (suite stage = `indicatorize`, per `A.19.CHR:4.5`; canonical stage‑op = `Indicatorize`):

  * `Indicatorize(CharacteristicSpaceSlot, CNSpecSlot, IndicatorChoicePolicySlot, CGSpecSlot?, MinimalEvidenceSlot?) → IndicatorSetSlot`; the cited specs supply the exact bearer and use qualifications.
* **LawSet** (CHR‑lawful indicatorization):

  1. **Selection‑only:** `Indicatorize` MUST NOT alter units, scales, and polarities; it only selects a subset (no implicit `UNM`).
  2. **Declared-basis restriction:** the resulting set MUST be a subset of the declared characteristic-space basis (as constrained by `CNSpecSlot.cs_basis` and `CNSpecSlot.chart`).
  3. **No implicit NCV⇒indicator:** measurability/NCV is not sufficient; indicators exist only via `IndicatorChoicePolicySlot` (cites `A.19.CN` `indicator_policy`).
  4. **Edition-determinism for the declared use:** for fixed editions of all **ByRef** inputs (`CharacteristicSpaceRef`, `CNSpecRef`, `IndicatorChoicePolicyRef`, and—when evidence-gated—`CGSpecRef` plus optional `MinimalEvidenceRef`) and fixed bearer, claim scope and selected slices, qualification window, evidence basis, and intended use, the `IndicatorSetSlot` result is stable.
  5. **No silent evidence coercion:** if evidence is insufficient/unknown under the chosen policy, the result MUST NOT be “silently emptied” nor silently treated as “pass”; use tri‑state guards.
* **AdmissibilityConditions** (tri‑state guard; fail‑closed on missing admissibility/evidence):

  * `IndicatorizeEligibility(CharacteristicSpaceSlot, CNSpecSlot, IndicatorChoicePolicySlot, CGSpecSlot?, MinimalEvidenceSlot?) → GuardDecision ∈ {pass|degrade|abstain}`.
  * `pass` requires: (i) `CNSpecSlot.indicator_policy` is present, (ii) `IndicatorChoicePolicySlot` matches that policy reference and edition, (iii) `CharacteristicSpaceSlot` matches the declared characteristic-space basis, and (iv) that policy's eligibility conditions hold for the exact bearer, claim scope and selected slices, qualification window, evidence basis, and intended use.
  * If the chosen `IndicatorChoicePolicy` is evidence‑gated:
    (i) `CGSpecSlot` MUST be present,
    (ii) define `EffectiveMinimalEvidence := (MinimalEvidenceSlot if present, else CGSpecSlot.MinimalEvidence)`,
    and (iii) insufficient/unknown evidence MUST yield `degrade` or `abstain` per the **effective** failure‑behavior policy (never a silent `pass`).
  * If the chosen `IndicatorChoicePolicy` is **not** evidence‑gated, absence of `MinimalEvidenceSlot` MUST NOT affect eligibility; no accidental “always‑evidence‑gated” behavior is permitted.
* **Applicability:**
  * Intended to be used before any scoring/comparison/selection that assumes an indicator profile, while remaining a distinct step (no hidden indicatorization inside downstream mechanisms).
  * Reuse for another bearer, source-local meaning, scope and window, evidence basis, reference plane, or intended use requires a new eligibility decision. Cite an F.9 Bridge, kind relation, or plane relation only when the new use actually relies on it.
  * Pin‑binding note: choosing concrete policy editions/pins is a planned baseline concern (P2W); UINDM only consumes those refs and records the effective ones in `Audit`.
* **Relation boundary:** indicatorization creates no transfer relation. When a receiving use relies on an obtaining F.9 Bridge, kind relation, or plane relation, cite it with direction, preserved or lost meaning, and receiving use; supported penalties route to **`R_eff` only**.
* **Γ_timePolicy:** `point` by default (no implicit “latest”).
* **PlaneRegime:** the indicator set keeps the reference plane declared by the characteristic-space and CN-Spec editions; UINDM introduces no plane shift.
  When a receiving conclusion depends on a relation between different planes, cite that exact plane relation, its direction and loss, and keep its use separate from the indicator set.
* **Audit:**

  * MUST record: `CharacteristicSpaceRef.edition`, `CNSpecRef.edition`, `IndicatorChoicePolicyRef.edition`, exact bearer, claim scope and selected slices, qualification window, evidence basis, and intended use.
  * When evidence‑gated, MUST record: `CGSpecRef.edition` and effective MinimalEvidence (`MinimalEvidenceRef` when provided; otherwise `CGSpecSlot.MinimalEvidence`).
  * SHOULD record: the realized `GuardDecision` (`pass|degrade|abstain`) and, when non‑`pass`, the policy‑bound failure behavior reference that justified it.
  * SHOULD record: a stable description of `IndicatorSetSlot` (or an id reference to a **citable** indicator-set publication unit), plus any F.9 Bridge, kind relation, or plane relation only when the result or receiving use actually relies on it.

#### A.19.UINDM:4.2 - Interpretation notes (informative)

* **IndicatorSet is a set of references, not values.** `IndicatorSetSlot` contains `U.CharacteristicRef` tokens; it does not compute measurements. The move from “chosen indicators” to “measured indicator profile” is performed downstream (e.g., via scoring/comparison), not by UINDM.

* **Subspace views are derived, not mandatory.** If a project needs an explicit subspace view, treat it as a derived support view `CS|_S` where `S = IndicatorSetSlot` over the base `CS = CharacteristicSpaceSlot`. Do not add a new mandatory output to the kernel signature; model a first-class subspace support view via `⊑⁺` only when it is genuinely needed.

* **Justification is optional and externalized.** The CHR SlotKind lexicon includes `JustificationSlot`, but the canonical UINDM intension does not require it.
  If a project needs a first‑class justification output, treat it as an **extension** (`⊑⁺`) rather than by mutating the base `Indicatorize` signature,
  and model the justification as a justification `U.Episteme` (e.g., `JustificationSlot : ⟨ValueKind = U.Episteme, refMode = U.EpistemeRef⟩`).

* **Evidence‑gated indicatorization is explicit.** Evidence gating is *not* default: it is activated only when the chosen `IndicatorChoicePolicy` is evidence‑gated, in which case `CGSpecSlot` and `MinimalEvidenceSlot` become required inputs to avoid “silent passes.”

### A.19.UINDM:5 - Archetypal Grounding (informative)

#### A.19.UINDM:5.1 - Tell

Think of UINDM as a **policy‑bound projection**:

* Input: “the declared characteristic basis for this exact bearer, claim scope and selected slices, qualification window, evidence basis, and intended use, plus an explicit indicator choice policy”
* Output: “the subset of characteristic references that are allowed to count as indicators for downstream CHR steps”

The key didactic boundary is: **UINDM chooses coordinates; it does not alter coordinates.**

#### A.19.UINDM:5.2 - Show (U.System) — cross‑unit engineering dashboard

A program manager maintains a `U.CharacteristicSpace` for manufacturing sites, including ~30 characteristics (quality, safety, cost, throughput, sustainability).

* The CN‑Spec’s `indicator_policy` for the “weekly executive dashboard” selects a subset:
  `{DefectRate, IncidentRate, UnitCost, LeadTime, EnergyPerUnit, OnTimeDelivery}`.
* UINDM runs `Indicatorize(...)` and outputs `IndicatorSetSlot =` those references.
* One site lacks reliable incident reporting for the last week. The indicator policy is evidence‑gated; `IndicatorizeEligibility` returns `degrade` (not `pass`), and the audit records the effective MinimalEvidence and the edition pins used.

Downstream mechanisms can now be held to the invariant: **they may only score/compare/select using the declared indicator profile (or explicitly abstain/degrade).** This avoids “dashboard drift” where different teams silently score on different subsets.

#### A.19.UINDM:5.3 - Show (U.Episteme) — robust evaluation across environments

A research lead wants indicators for model robustness under distribution shift (different hospitals, sensors, geographies).

* The declared characteristic-space basis includes many candidate metrics (accuracy slices, calibration, subgroup error, OOD detection quality).
* The indicator choice policy is “invariance‑driven”: prefer indicators whose semantics remain stable under environment changes; deprioritize proxy metrics known to be environment‑sensitive.
* UINDM returns an indicator set used by the scoring and comparison stages; uncertain indicators are handled via tri‑state guarding rather than coerced to zero or silently dropped.

### A.19.UINDM:6 - Bias-Annotation (informative)

* **Gov (governance).** Bias toward explicit policy surfaces (`IndicatorChoicePolicyRef`, edition pins, auditable outcomes) rather than tacit “expert choice.” Risk: perceived extra work. Mitigation: keep the mechanism minimal (selection‑only) and push method detail into wiring modules.

* **Arch (architecture).** Bias toward stable interfaces: SlotKind tokens come from the suite lexicon and evidence gates are explicit inputs. Risk: reduced “quick hacks.” Mitigation: allow `⊑⁺` extensions for richer outputs (e.g., justification) without mutating the kernel signature.

* **Onto/Epist.** Bias toward a strict distinction between “measurable characteristic” and “indicator under policy.” Risk: teams accustomed to “everything measurable is an indicator” may resist. Mitigation: embed this as an explicit LawSet clause (“No implicit NCV⇒indicator”).

* **Prag (pragmatics).** Bias toward fail‑closed guards and traceability under uncertainty. Risk: more `abstain/degrade` outcomes early. Mitigation: couple `degrade` with explicit downstream behaviors (policy‑bound) rather than silent coercions.

* **Did (didactics).** Bias toward “one place to learn the mechanism”: the problem/forces/solution narrative is co‑located with the canonical Mechanism.Intension.

### A.19.UINDM:7 - Conformance Checklist

A UINDM publication or use is conformant if it satisfies:

1. **Mechanism.Intension completeness.** The mechanism publication includes the full intension shape (header/imports/subject/slot index/op algebra/laws/admissibility/applicability/transport/time/plane/audit), and uses the tri‑state guard form. SlotIndex is treated as a **derived** projection. (See `CC‑UM.0/CC‑UM.1/CC‑UM.9`.)

2. **SlotKind discipline.** SlotKind tokens match the CHR SlotKind lexicon for the roles used (`CharacteristicSpaceSlot`, `CNSpecSlot`, `IndicatorChoicePolicySlot`, etc.); no generic `ContextSlot` is introduced. New SlotKinds, if any, first extend the suite lexicon rather than appearing ad hoc in the mechanism.

3. **Selection‑only behavior.** `Indicatorize` does not alter units, scales, and polarities, does not perform implicit normalization, and does not enlarge the declared characteristic-space basis.

4. **No NCV shortcut.** “Measurable/NCV” is not treated as sufficient for indicatorhood; indicatorhood arises only via `IndicatorChoicePolicySlot` consistent with `CN‑Spec.indicator_policy`.

5. **Evidence gating is explicit.** When the chosen `IndicatorChoicePolicy` is evidence‑gated, `CGSpecSlot` is present and the effective MinimalEvidence is explicit and auditable
   (`MinimalEvidenceSlot` when provided; otherwise `CGSpecSlot.MinimalEvidence`); insufficient/unknown evidence must yield `degrade/abstain` per the effective failure‑behavior policy, never a silent `pass`.

6. **Reuse is explicit.** Another bearer, scope and window, basis, plane, or intended use gets a fresh eligibility decision; any F.9 Bridge, kind relation, or plane relation is cited only when the conclusion relies on that obtaining relation, with supported loss routed to `R_eff`.

7. **Gate/guard separation + lexeme discipline.** UINDM uses `…Eligibility` returning `GuardDecision ∈ {pass|degrade|abstain}` and does not embed GateDecision/GateLog in suite steps.
   Reserved gate‑lexemes (e.g., `…Guard`) are not used for mechanism‑level predicates; the mechanism stays at the guard/admissibility layer.

8. **P2W seam is preserved.** Planned slot fillings and edition pin‑bindings are not authored inside this mechanism intension; they are bound as WorkPlanning plan items under P2W and surfaced at run‑time only via `Audit` refs and pins.

9. **Specialization discipline (if extended).** Any specialization of UINDM (`⊑/⊑⁺`) MUST follow the multi‑level specialization discipline (`A.6.1:4.2.1`, `CC‑UM.8`): SlotKind invariance for inherited ops, no new mandatory inputs to the inherited `Indicatorize` op, and any extra outputs (e.g., justification outputs or subspace support views) expressed only via `⊑⁺`.

### A.19.UINDM:8 - Common Anti‑Patterns and How to Avoid Them

* **“NCV ⇒ indicator.”** Treating all measurable characteristics as indicators. Violates “No implicit NCV⇒indicator.”

* **Indicatorization hidden in scoring.** A scoring method silently ignores some characteristics or introduces an implicit “feature selection” without an explicit indicator set.

* **Silent emptying.** When evidence is insufficient, returning an empty indicator set (or treating missing evidence as “pass”) without a tri‑state guard decision.

* **Reusing an indicator set after its basis or use changed.** Reusing it for another bearer, scope and window, evidence basis, reference plane, or intended use without a new eligibility decision; or naming Bridge or plane-relation pins without an actual obtaining relation.

* **Smuggling plan‑binding into the mechanism.** Binding concrete edition pins / planned slot fillings (“launch values”) inside the UINDM description instead of using the P2W seam (WorkPlanning) and recording only effective refs/pins in `Audit`.

* **GateDecision leakage.** Emitting or implying GateDecision/GateLog as part of the `indicatorize` step (gate decisions are separated from suite steps; keep UINDM at guard+audit level).

### A.19.UINDM:9 - Consequences

**Benefits**

* Makes “which characteristics count as indicators” explicit, auditable, and policy‑bound.
* Prevents downstream semantic drift by freezing an indicator subset early in the CHR pipeline.
* Improves reproducibility via edition‑determinism (fixed editions ⇒ stable result).
* Preserves evolvability: new indicator selection method families can be added via wiring (packs/extensions) without changing the mechanism’s intension.

**Costs / trade‑offs**

* Adds an explicit step (and explicit policy work) before scoring/comparison.
* Strict fail‑closed behavior can increase early `degrade/abstain` outcomes until evidence and policies are properly specified.

### A.19.UINDM:10 - Rationale

Indicatorization is separated because it is a different kind of commitment than scoring or comparison:

* Indicatorization commits to **which coordinates are allowed to matter** under policy.
* Scoring/aggregation/comparison commit to **how** allowed coordinates are transformed, folded, or ordered under admissibility gates.

By making indicatorization selection‑only, UINDM avoids “semantic alchemy” (changing meanings while claiming to merely “pick indicators”) and supports the CHR suite’s broader discipline: explicit spec refs, explicit crossings, and explicit handling of uncertainty via tri‑state guards.

### A.19.UINDM:11 - SoTA-Echoing

**SoTA vs popular note.** This section records alignment to post‑2015 evidence‑backed practice. It is **not** a mandate to use fashionable methods; method semantics stay in SoTA packs (`G.2`) and wiring modules, while this pattern fixes the stable mechanism boundary.

**Pack note (Phase‑3):** this pattern does not currently cite a UINDM‑specific `G.2` SoTA pack/ClaimSheet. If/when such a pack is introduced, replace the bibliographic pointers below with the pack’s `ClaimSheetId` citations, keeping the mechanism semantics unchanged.

#### A.19.UINDM:11.1 - SoTA alignment map (normative)

| SoTA practice pointer (post‑2015+) | Primary source (post‑2015+) | Where it connects to UINDM | Adoption status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Prefer indicators stable under environment shift (avoid spurious proxies) | IRM / invariant prediction line ([arXiv][1]) | Expressed as **policy freedom** (`IndicatorChoicePolicySlot`) + explicit `Transport` + fail‑closed eligibility; method details stay out of the kernel | Adapt |
| Treat “why these indicators” as a first-class justification episteme, not tribal knowledge | Model Cards documentation discipline ([ACM Digital Library][2]) | Expressed as minimal but decisive `Audit` + optional `⊑⁺` justification output (without mutating the kernel signature) | Adapt |
| Keep architectural commitments traceable to one governing pattern (avoid “second centers of gravity”) | ISO/IEC/IEEE 42010:2022 “Systems and software engineering — Architecture description” | Expressed as the explicit governing-pattern hook + “Tell + Cite” stubs elsewhere (no competing semantics) | Adopt |

**Notes per row (SoTA‑Echoing; not method mandates).**
1. *Invariance under shift.* UINDM does not “implement IRM”; it merely makes room for invariance‑driven indicator policies to be wired while keeping the kernel selection‑only.
2. *Justification discipline.* UINDM keeps justification optional at the kernel level; if a justification publication or record is required, add it via `⊑⁺` so the base signature stays stable.
3. *Governing-pattern traceability.* The ISO architecture‑description discipline is used here only to motivate “one governing pattern + Tell + Cite stubs”; it does not add new Part‑A governing spec refs.
