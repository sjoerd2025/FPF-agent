## A.19.UNM - Unified Normalization Mechanism (UNM)

> **Type:** Architectural (A)
> **Status:** Stable
> **Normativity:** Normative (unless explicitly marked informative)
> **Placement:** Part A / CN‑Spec cluster (A.19) / CHR mechanism-governing patterns
> **Governing-pattern note (Phase‑3 canonicalization):** This pattern governs the meaning of `UNM.IntensionRef` (per `E.20`). The canonical publication anchor for `UNM.IntensionRef` remains `A.19.UNM`, while `A.6.1` governs the `U.Mechanism.Intension` **template**.
> **Boundary note:** The `CN_Spec` surface itself (incl. `CN_Spec.normalization` and `CN_Spec.comparability`) remains governed by `A.19.CN`; this pattern specifies only UNM’s stable semantic surface and how UNM **consumes/interprets** the CN‑frame routing fields (no shadow CN‑spec).
> **ID‑continuity:** legacy UNM mentions remain valid via *Tell + Cite* stubs (e.g., cite `A.19.UNM:4.1`).
> **Canonicalization hook (Phase‑3):** Any other location that mentions UNM (including legacy “card fragments”) SHALL be reduced to *Tell + Cite* and SHALL NOT restate `SlotIndex / OperationAlgebra / LawSet / AdmissibilityConditions / Applicability / Transport, Γ_timePolicy, PlaneRegime, and Audit`. This is the usability+didactic guard against “scattered semantics”.
**If someone says “we normalized”, ask (in this order):**
1) Which **`UNM_id`** (if applicable) and which **`NormalizationMethodInstanceId`** (and its validity window) was used?
2) Which **`NormalizationInvariant[*]`** were declared (i.e., *what is preserved*)?
3) Which **bearer, scope/window, reference or comparison basis, evidence, and intended comparison** were recorded, and does this use actually rely on an F.9 Bridge, kind relation, or plane relation?

**Mental model.** UNM **re‑parameterizes** a raw coordinate value (`CV`) into an `NCV` *under declared invariants* and exposes `≡_UNM` so downstream steps can be stated as “compare on invariants” *explicitly* (and audited).

### A.19.UNM:0 - At a glance — didactic, informative

**Intent.** Provide a single, explicit normalization mechanism for **coordinate values** in a `U.CharacteristicSpace`, so that **comparability** and downstream characterization steps can be stated as “**normalize-then-compare**” (governance), rather than as hidden arithmetic inside scoring/selection.

**Where it sits.**
- **CN-frame governance card:** `CN_Spec.normalization` + `CN_Spec.comparability.mode` route whether comparison is `coordinatewise` or `normalization-based`.
- **CHR suite role:** stage `normalize` (first-stage, when enabled by the suite protocol / comparability routing).

**Key outputs.**
- `NCV` (NormalizedCharacteristicValue) values for coordinates.
- A declared congruence `≡_UNM` (equivalence) induced by a chosen normalization method instance.
- Optionally, an explicit representative selection policy (`NormalizationFixSpec`, aka “NormalizationFix” in prose) when quotient objects must be presented as concrete chart items.

**Two IDs (do not conflate).**
- `UNM_id?` selects the **UNM mechanism instance** used by this CN‑frame (a `U.Mechanism` instance of type UNM; routing/governance level).
- `NormalizationMethodInstanceId` selects the **normalization method instance** applied to specific coordinate(s), with its validity window and evidence pins (method/application level).

**Minimum declaration set (didactic).**
- In `CN_Spec.comparability`: set `mode`, and (when UNM participates in acceptance/comparison) set `minimal_evidence`.
- In `CN_Spec.normalization`: declare `UNM_id?`, `methods`, `instances`, `method_descriptions`, `invariants`, and (if representatives are required) `fix`.
- In Audit: cite the chosen `NormalizationMethodInstanceId`, `NormalizationMethodDescriptionRef.edition`, characteristic-space and CN-Spec editions, bearer, scope/window, reference or comparison basis, invariants, evidence, and intended comparison. Cite a Bridge, kind relation, or plane relation only when the result or receiving use actually relies on it.

**Non-goals.**
- Not indicator selection (that is **UINDM**).
- Not scoring, aggregation, comparison, selection (USCM / ULSAM / CPM / SelectorMechanism).
- Not a data governance system: UNM is a concept-level mechanism with an explicit governing pattern and auditability.

**Governing-pattern note (Phase‑3 canonicalization).**
This pattern is the governing pattern for the canonical `U.Mechanism.Intension` for `UNM.IntensionRef`. Other locations that currently carry UNM “card fragments” should be reduced to **Tell + Cite** stubs pointing here, preserving public IDs/anchors.

### A.19.UNM:1 - Problem frame

FPF needs a disciplined way to talk about **measurable slots** (coordinates/scales) such that engineers can reason about:
- **What it means** to compare values across charts, slices, bearers, or reference bases, and
- **Where the “meaning-preserving” transformations live**, so comparisons are lawful and explainable.

In practice, teams routinely face a mismatch between:
- values that look comparable (“they’re numbers”), and
- values that are not comparable without normalization—for example, because their units, scale types, reference planes, bearer or population assumptions, comparison bases, intended uses, or validity windows differ.

FPF’s CHR family explicitly separates stages (normalize → indicatorize → score → fold → compare → select). UNM is the *normalization* stage, and its job is to make “compare-on-invariants” explicit and auditable.

### A.19.UNM:2 - Problem

Without an explicit UNM governing pattern:

1) **Normalization drifts into hidden places.** It gets embedded inside scoring, comparison, or selection, making admissibility and governance non-local.

2) **Comparability becomes rhetorical.** People say “we normalize” but cannot answer:
   *Which method? Which invariants? Which bearer, comparison basis, scope and window? Which evidence? Does the receiving comparison rely on an actual Bridge, kind relation, or plane relation?*

3) **Basis and relation changes become invisible.** Teams reuse normalizations for another bearer, comparison basis, source-local meaning, or reference plane without naming what changed or the relation on which the new use depends.

4) **Engineers cannot reconstruct the mechanism.** When UNM semantics are scattered, the pattern structure (problem/forces/solution) is lost, hurting didactic use by engineering managers.

### A.19.UNM:3 - Forces

| Force | Tension |
|---|---|
| **Evolvability vs Usability** | Stable mechanism surface ↔ method families evolve; single place to read ↔ modular wiring. |
| **Semantic precision vs Cognitive load** | Formal invariants/quotients ↔ a mechanism description that engineers can act on. |
| **Governing-pattern discipline vs Cross-cutting reality** | UNM touches CN, CG, transport, and plane claims ↔ avoid “shadow specs” and duplicate centers of gravity. |
| **Trustworthiness vs Overreach** | “Normalization is legitimate” must be evidence-backed ↔ UNM must not pretend to define measurement meaning itself. |
| **Locality vs Reuse** | A normalized value is valid for a declared bearer, basis, scope, window, and use ↔ a later use may need a separately supported relation or a new normalization. |
| **Fail-closed safety vs Convenience** | Unknown/insufficient evidence must not coerce ↔ teams want “a number anyway”. |

### A.19.UNM:4 - Solution

UNM is a `U.Mechanism` that normalizes coordinate values using declared method classes, producing:
- normalized values (`NCV`),
- an induced congruence `≡_UNM`,
- and (when needed) a representative policy (`NormalizationFix`) for quotient objects.

UNM is **not** a bag of algorithms. It is a **canonical semantic surface**:
- **Routing** lives in `CN_Spec.normalization` and `CN_Spec.comparability.mode`.
- **Evidence/calibration legitimacy** lives in `C.16 (MM‑CHR)`.
- **Method families** can be supplied by SoTA packs and wired via extensions, without mutating UNM’s surface.

#### A.19.UNM:4.0 - Vocabulary (normative)

**NormalizationMethodId.** A stable token naming a normalization method *kind*, used in `CN_Spec.normalization.methods`.

**NormalizationMethod.** The method *kind* (class) that defines:
1) the **invariants** it preserves (`NormalizationInvariant[*]`),
2) its **closure rules** (composition, and inverses where defined), and
3) its **validity rules** (admitted bearer, scope, qualification window, reference or comparison basis, and intended-use constraints).

**NormalizationMethodDescription.** An editioned epistemic description of a normalization method (bounds, validity region/window, scope constraints, and evidence links governed by `C.16`).
**NormalizationMethodDescriptionRef.** A ref to an editioned `NormalizationMethodDescription`, used in `CN_Spec.normalization.method_descriptions`.

**NormalizationMethodInstanceId.** A stable token naming a concrete, declared application of a normalization method to specific coordinate(s)/slot(s) in a base `U.CharacteristicSpace`, with a named validity window and (when required) evidence pins. Used in `CN_Spec.normalization.instances`.

**NormalizationMethodInstance.** The instance binding itself (conceptual); referenced in specs/logs/gates by `NormalizationMethodInstanceId`.

**CV (CoordinateValue).** A raw coordinate value for a **named measurable slot** in a chart: conceptually `⟨slot_id, raw_value⟩` (plus any chart/slice scoping needed by the chart). UNM re‑parameterizes `CV → NCV` under declared invariants and validity constraints.

**NCV (NormalizedCharacteristicValue).** A normalized **value** for a coordinate (UNM does **not** “normalize characteristics”; it normalizes coordinate values under declared invariants).

**`≡_UNM` (UNM-congruence).** The equivalence relation induced by one chosen `NormalizationMethodInstance` for its declared characteristic-space and CN-Spec editions, bearer, scope/window, reference or comparison basis, and intended comparison.
Two charts (or chart items/views) are `≡_UNM` iff they are related by a finite chain of admissible transformations that preserve the declared invariants.

**NormalizationInvariant.** A named invariant (e.g., unit alignment, polarity, reference plane) declared in `CN_Spec.normalization.invariants` and/or the selected `NormalizationMethodDescription`. Preserving the declared `NormalizationInvariant[*]` is the core admissibility claim for a normalization method instance.

**NormalizationFixSpec.** A declared policy selecting a canonical representative of a `≡_UNM` equivalence class when downstream consumers require a concrete chart item/view. Bound via `CN_Spec.normalization.fix` (otherwise keep quotient objects abstract).
**UNM_id.** An optional identifier in `CN_Spec.normalization.UNM_id?` selecting the UNM **mechanism instance** used by this CN‑frame. This is routing/governance; it is distinct from `NormalizationMethodInstanceId` (method/application).
**ValidityWindow.** A named validity window attached to a `NormalizationMethodInstanceId`, bounding where/when the instance is admissible (no implicit “latest”).

**Relation and reuse boundary.** A normalized value remains tied to the exact normalization-method instance and edition, characteristic-space and CN-Spec editions, bearer, scope and window, reference or comparison basis, evidence, and intended comparison. Reusing it does not by itself establish a transfer relation. Cite an F.9 Bridge or a plane relation only when that relation actually obtains, and state the receiving use separately.
**Lexical guard (strict distinction).** Avoid the word **`map`** / **`mapping`** for UNM transforms (especially `Map`), because `Map` is a specialized FPF term and creates ontology drift. Prefer “normalization”, “re‑parameterization”, “transform under invariants”.
Legacy κ‑notation for normalization is retired; do not re‑introduce it.

#### A.19.UNM:4.1 - UNM as a `U.Mechanism.Intension` (normative)

**Scope note.** This Mechanism.Intension is authored to the `U.Mechanism.Intension` **shape** governed by `A.6.1`. It defines only UNM’s stable *semantic surface*. It does **not** bind project pins (editions/policy‑ids), which belong to the P2W seam (`A.15.3` + `A.19.CHR`), and it does **not** emit `GateDecision`/`GateLog`. It may emit tri‑state `GuardDecision` and Audit pins.

**IntensionHeader**
- `IntensionId`: `UNM`
- `IntensionRef`: `UNM.IntensionRef`
- `Name`: Unified Normalization Mechanism
- `Status`: Stable
- `Version`: `v1.0`
- `SuiteRole`: CHR.normalize (when enabled by CN/CHR routing)

**Imports (cite, don’t duplicate)**
- `A.6.1` (shape: `U.Mechanism.Intension`, specialization discipline)
- `A.6.5` (slot discipline; SlotIndex is a projection)
- `A.19.CHR:4.2` (CHR suite boundary / membership)
- `A.19.CHR:4.2.1` (CHR SlotKind Lexicon)
- `A.19.CHR:4.5` (suite protocols: ordering/optionality; suite closure)
- `A.19.CN` (CN-frame routing: `normalization`, `comparability.mode`)
- `G.0` (CG-frame admissibility gates where required downstream)
- `C.16` (evidence carriers; calibration/validity for normalization legitimacy)
- `A.17/A.18` (measurement meaning & scale lawfulness; not redefined here)

**SubjectBlock**
- `SubjectKind`: `NormalizationMethod classes` (with induced `≡_UNM` over admitted chart items or views)
- `GovernedValueDomain`: coordinate values (`CV`) for named measurable slots in the exact `U.CharacteristicSpace` and CN-Spec editions; UNM normalizes **values**, not characteristics
- `BearerAndUseBoundary`: the exact bearer, scope and window, reference or comparison basis, evidence, and intended comparison declared for those values
- `ExtentRule`: “coordinate values admitted by the selected CN-Spec for this bearer and use, within the normalization-method instance's declared validity window”
- `ResultKinds`:
  - `NormalizedCharacteristicValue (NCV)`
  - `UNM-congruence (≡_UNM)`
  - optional quotient objects and/or `Normalization-fixed` representatives (via `NormalizationFixSpec`)
**SlotIndex (derived projection; minimum)**
- `CharacteristicSpaceSlot : ⟨ValueKind = U.CharacteristicSpace, refMode = U.CharacteristicSpaceRef⟩`
- `CNSpecSlot : ⟨ValueKind = CN‑Spec, refMode = CNSpecRef⟩`
- The `CNSpecSlot` resolves the exact bearer, claim scope and selected slices, qualification window, reference or comparison basis, evidence requirements, and intended comparison; these qualify the use and do not form a generic setting SlotKind.

UNM‑specific slots (must be alias‑docked into the CHR SlotKind lexicon if used across the suite):
- `NormalizationMethodInstanceSlot : ⟨ValueKind = NormalizationMethodInstanceId, refMode = ByValue⟩`
- `NormalizationMethodDescriptionSlot? : ⟨ValueKind = NormalizationMethodDescription, refMode = NormalizationMethodDescriptionRef⟩`
- `NormalizationInvariantSetSlot? : ⟨ValueKind = NormalizationInvariant[*], refMode = ByValue⟩`
- `NormalizationMethodInstancePairSlot? : ⟨ValueKind = NormalizationMethodInstanceId[2], refMode = ByValue⟩`  *(used only by `compose`; roles = {inner, outer})*
- `CoordinateValueSlot : ⟨ValueKind = CV, refMode = ByValue⟩`
- `NCVSlot : ⟨ValueKind = NCV, refMode = ByValue⟩`
- `UNMCongruenceSlot : ⟨ValueKind = UNM‑congruence (≡_UNM), refMode = ByValue⟩`
- `NormalizationFixSlot? : ⟨ValueKind = NormalizationFixSpec, refMode = ByValue⟩`

**Authoring note (didactic).** `NormalizationMethodDescriptionSlot`, `NormalizationInvariantSetSlot`, and `NormalizationFixSlot` are typically *resolved/derived* from `CN_Spec.normalization.{method_descriptions,invariants,fix}` plus the selected `NormalizationMethodInstanceId`. They are listed here because they participate in eligibility/audit semantics — not because every operation takes them as explicit inputs.

**Relation note (not a SlotKind).** A Bridge, kind relation, or plane relation is cited only when the use relies on that obtaining relation. Its declaration and receiving use remain separate from the UNM SlotIndex.

**OperationAlgebra (conceptual)**
1) `apply`
   - Preconditions: `UNM_Eligibility(…) ∈ {pass, degrade}` (fail‑closed; `abstain` ⇒ no NCV output).
   - Inputs: `NormalizationMethodInstanceSlot`, `CoordinateValueSlot`, `CharacteristicSpaceSlot`, `CNSpecSlot`; the selected CN-Spec supplies the exact bearer, scope/window, basis, evidence requirements, and intended comparison.
   - Outputs: `NCVSlot` (+ availability of `UNMCongruenceSlot` for the same method instance)

2) `compose`
   - Purpose: build a composed method (only when explicitly declared lawful).
   - Inputs: `NormalizationMethodInstancePairSlot` (roles = {inner, outer}), `CharacteristicSpaceSlot`, `CNSpecSlot`; both instances must be admitted for the same declared bearer, scope/window, basis, and intended use.
   - Output: `NormalizationMethodInstanceSlot` (new composed `NormalizationMethodInstanceId`), with an explicit validity window and evidence pins.

3) `quotient(≡_UNM)`
- Inputs: `CharacteristicSpaceSlot` (or chart view), `NormalizationMethodInstanceSlot`
- Output: quotient object under `UNMCongruenceSlot`
  (When a concrete representative is required, `NormalizationFixSlot` (`NormalizationFixSpec`) must be declared and used.)

**LawSet (UNM laws; identifiers are stable)**
- **UNM‑L0 (Values, not characteristics).** UNM produces `NCV` as a **value** under declared invariants; it does not redefine the underlying characteristic meaning (measurement meaning remains governed by A.17/A.18 and evidence by C.16).
- **UNM‑L1 (Declared method class gate).** A normalization method instance is admissible only if its method is declared in the allowed method class set: `{ratio:scale, interval:affine, ordinal:monotone, nominal:categorical, tabular:LUT(+uncertainty)}`.
- **UNM‑L1a (Method semantics are governed by the method).** `NormalizationMethod` defines invariants, closure (composition / inverses where defined), and validity rules. UNM consumes these declarations; it does not invent extra admissibility.
- **UNM‑L2 (Congruence is first-class).** Each chosen method instance induces `≡_UNM` over charts/views; equality/comparability decisions that rely on normalization are defined on the quotient (or on a declared fix), not on raw labels.
- **UNM-L2a (Declared-basis locality).** `≡_UNM` holds only for the selected method instance, characteristic-space and CN-Spec editions, bearer, scope and window, reference or comparison basis, and intended comparison. A later use must show that those premises still hold or constitute a new result.
- **UNM‑L3 (Fail‑closed).** If admissibility/evidence is insufficient (or required inputs are missing/stale), UNM does not silently coerce; it yields `abstain` or `degrade` (tri‑state guard discipline) and may surface an explicit freshness/work request (see A.19.UNM:4.5).
  *Didactic reading:* `abstain` ⇒ no lawful NCV/comparability for this slice; `degrade` ⇒ NCV may be produced but must be treated as policy‑gated and auditable (never “quietly good enough”).
- **UNM‑L4 (No implicit indicatorization).** `NCV` does not imply “indicator”; indicator status is a separate policy step (UINDM).
- **UNM-L5 (Relation before reuse).** When a receiving comparison depends on an F.9 Bridge, kind relation, or plane relation, cite the exact obtaining relation, its direction, what it preserves or loses, and the receiving use. A change of bearer, scope, corpus, scale, method, or window is not by itself such a relation. Supported penalties route to the **R-lane only** (never to F/G; if scalarized, into `R_eff`).
- **UNM‑L6 (Time explicitness).** Validity windows are named; no implicit “latest”.
- **UNM‑L7 (Auditability).** The applied method and CN-Spec editions, normalized values, bearer, scope and window, comparison basis, evidence pins, intended comparison, and any actually relied-on Bridge, kind relation, or plane relation must be auditable as refs or pins.
- **UNM-L8 (No shadow writers).** Downstream patterns cite the exact method, CN-Spec, basis, and evidence editions they use; they do not re-author those anchors or make a registry substitute for them.
- **UNM‑L9 (No publish/telemetry ops).** UNM defines no publish/telemetry step. Any publication/telemetry is out of suite closure and does not mutate UNM semantics (`NCV`, `≡_UNM`, quotient/fix); only Audit pins are produced here.

**AdmissibilityConditions**
Definition (UNM‑Eligibility):
`UNM_Eligibility(NormalizationMethodInstanceSlot, CoordinateValueSlot, CharacteristicSpaceSlot, CNSpecSlot) → GuardDecision`
where `GuardDecision ∈ {pass | degrade | abstain}` and follows this predicate semantics:
- **pass** iff all of the following hold:
  - (**CN-Spec binding**) the selected `NormalizationMethodInstanceId` is declared in `CN_Spec.normalization.instances` (or an equivalent declared surface), its method kind is included in `CN_Spec.normalization.methods`, and (if present) it satisfies `normalization.admissible_reparameterizations`; the exact characteristic-space and CN-Spec editions, bearer, claim scope and selected slices, qualification window, reference or comparison basis, and intended comparison are recoverable;
  - (**Target coordinate binding**) the input `CV`’s `slot_id` belongs to the method instance’s declared bound coordinate set;
  - (**Scale‑regime compatibility**) the method kind is compatible with the coordinate’s regime (`ratio:scale | interval:affine | ordinal:monotone | nominal:categorical | tabular:LUT(+uncertainty)`) and preserves the declared `NormalizationInvariant[*]` (from `CN_Spec.normalization.invariants` and/or the method description);
  - (**Validity window**) the method instance’s validity window covers the active slice/time policy (no implicit “latest”);
  - (**Evidence sufficiency when routed into governance**) when `comparability.mode = normalization-based` (or downstream uses `NCV` in gated decisions), the method instance’s evidence pins satisfy `CN_Spec.comparability.minimal_evidence` (structure typically gated by `G.0`; evidence semantics governed by `C.16`).
- **degrade** iff all non‑evidence conditions above hold, but the evidence check does not pass and the declared failure behavior permits producing a policy‑gated degraded `NCV` rather than abstaining.
- **abstain** otherwise (including missing binding, coordinate mismatch, out‑of‑window validity, or evidence failure when the declared failure behavior is abstain).

**Applicability**
UNM is applicable when:
- `CN_Spec.comparability.mode = normalization-based`, or
- a declared downstream step requires “compare-on-invariants” and thus requires explicit normalization.
UNM is typically skipped when `comparability.mode = coordinatewise` (unless an explicit downstream step requires a declared quotient/fix anyway).

**Relation and reuse boundary**
- A normalized value remains local to the exact method instance and edition, characteristic-space and CN-Spec editions, bearer, scope and window, reference or comparison basis, evidence, and intended comparison recorded for it.
- If a receiving use depends on a relation between distinct source-local meanings, cite the exact F.9 Bridge, its direction, what it preserves or loses, and that receiving use. If reference planes differ and the comparison depends on their relation, cite the exact plane relation as a separate claim.
- A changed bearer, scope, corpus, scale, method, or window does not by itself establish either relation. If the bearer kind also changes, state the separate kind relation rather than hiding it inside a Bridge. Any loss penalty remains on the R-lane and is used only when the corresponding relation claim supports it.
**Γ_timePolicy**
- Default: `point` (no implicit “latest”).
- If normalization relies on time windows, the validity window is part of the method instance and must be declared.

**PlaneRegime**
- A normalized value keeps the reference plane declared for its input and intended comparison; normalization creates no implicit plane crossing.
- When a comparison actually relies on a relation between different planes, cite that exact relation, its direction and loss, and keep its use separate from the normalization result.
**Audit**
Audit records MUST include:
- `CNSpecRef.edition` + `comparability.mode`, the exact `U.CharacteristicSpace` edition, and the evaluated bearer
- (when present) `CN_Spec.normalization.UNM_id` (the selected UNM mechanism instance id for this CN-Spec)
- chosen `NormalizationMethodInstanceId`, its validity window, and any `NormalizationMethodDescriptionRef.edition`
- declared `NormalizationInvariant[*]` and `NormalizationFixSpec` (if used)
- any declared admissible re-parameterizations (if present in `CN_Spec.normalization`)
- claim scope and selected slices, reference or comparison basis, intended comparison, and all evidence pins used by the instance
- an exact F.9 Bridge, kind relation, or plane relation only when the recorded result or receiving use actually relies on it, including direction, preserved or lost meaning, and the receiving use
- any emitted `FreshnessRequest` / work request identifiers (when applicable; see A.19.UNM:4.5)

#### A.19.UNM:4.2 - CN-frame wiring: `normalization` and comparability routing (normative-by-reference)

**Tell.** CN-frame does not “do normalization”; it **routes** normalization.
- `comparability.mode ∈ {coordinatewise, normalization-based}` governs whether comparisons are done directly or “normalize-then-compare”.
- `normalization.UNM_id?` selects the UNM mechanism instance used by this CN-frame.
- `normalization.methods / instances / method_descriptions / invariants / fix` provide the declared surface that UNM consumes.
(If present) `normalization.admissible_reparameterizations` constrain which re‑parameterizations count as “admissible” under the declared invariants.
(See CN-frame definition in `A.19.CN`; `A.19.CN` remains the governing pattern of the CN-frame surface. This section only states the UNM consumption/interpretation constraints and does not introduce a shadow spec.)

#### A.19.UNM:4.3 - Evidence and calibration are governed by MM‑CHR (normative-by-reference)

UNM does not claim “this normalization is legitimate” by decree.
Instead, the legitimacy claim is supported by evidence carriers, calibration records, and validity records governed by `C.16 (MM‑CHR)` and referenced from the chosen `NormalizationMethodInstance`.

#### A.19.UNM:4.4 - Didactic rule: quotients or fixes, never “labels” (normative)

When UNM is used to support comparability/acceptance:
- Think in **invariants and equivalence classes** (quotients), not in labels.
- If a concrete representative is needed, declare a `NormalizationFix` explicitly.
Do not silently treat an arbitrary representative as canonical.

#### A.19.UNM:4.5 - P2W and transformation-flow integration note (normative-by-reference)

When UNM is used inside transformation-flow structures/graphs (e.g., `E.18`):
- UNM occurs **before** selection/decision steps.
- If required measurements are **missing or stale**, UNM does not “guess a number”; it surfaces an explicit **freshness/work request** that must be planned in `U.WorkPlanning` and executed in `U.WorkEnactment`.
- A receiving step cites the exact normalized values, method and CN-Spec editions, bearer, scope/window, comparison basis, evidence and intended use. It cites a Bridge, kind relation or plane relation only when its conclusion actually relies on that obtaining relation and keeps any supported loss on the R-lane.
- Downstream consumers cite editioned method, basis and evidence anchors as refs and do not re-author them.

### A.19.UNM:5 - Archetypal Grounding (Tell–Show–Show)

**Tell.** UNM is the conceptual “front gate” that turns “raw coordinate values” into “values comparable under declared invariants”, by:
1) choosing an admissible normalization method instance (with evidence and validity window),
2) applying it to produce NCVs,
3) exposing `≡_UNM` and (optionally) quotient/fix structure so downstream mechanisms can remain lawful and explicit.

**Show (System).** A team compares alternatives using `normalization-based` comparability:
- CN-Spec declares:
  - `comparability.mode = normalization-based`
  - `normalization.invariants = {unit-alignment, polarity}`
  - a method instance `M_unitScale` with validity window `VW_2026Q1` and evidence pins.
- UNM applies `M_unitScale` to each coordinate value, producing NCVs.
- CPM compares the NCV-profiles (not raw profiles).
- If evidence pins are missing for a slice, UNM returns `GuardDecision = abstain`, preventing “fake comparability”.

**Show (Episteme).** Quotient thinking:
- Two chart items `x` and `y` are different raw values (different units or reference planes).
- Under a chosen normalization method instance, `x ≡_UNM y` holds.
- Comparability claims are made over `[x]_{≡_UNM}` and `[y]_{≡_UNM}` (equivalence classes).
- If reporting needs a single representative, a declared `NormalizationFix` selects it; otherwise, do not pretend a representative is canonical.

**Show (P2W and transformation flow).** Missing/stale inputs:
- A selector (or comparator) requires comparability under `normalization-based` mode.
- UNM finds that a required coordinate value is missing/stale for the current slice and the instance validity window.
- UNM returns `GuardDecision = abstain` (fail‑closed) **and** emits a `FreshnessRequest` that must be handled via planned baseline + enactment (UNM does not silently proceed).

### A.19.UNM:6 - Bias‑Annotation

Common cognitive traps around normalization:
- **Normalization-as-truth bias:** treating NCVs as “objective” instead of “objective under declared invariants and validity window”.
- **Hidden-steps bias:** assuming normalization “happened somewhere” and skipping explicit routing/pins.
- **Unit-blindness:** treating numeric sameness as semantic sameness.
- **Proxy legitimacy:** assuming a popular method is legitimate without evidence pins or validity region.

Mitigation: enforce explicit `NormalizationMethodInstance` + validity window + evidence pins; and keep `≡_UNM`/quotient semantics explicit.

### A.19.UNM:7 - Conformance Checklist

- [ ] **Template compliance:** canonical E.8 sections 1–13 present in order; pattern ends with `### A.19.UNM:End`.
- [ ] **Terminology:** uses `NormalizationMethodId`, `NormalizationMethodInstanceId`, `NormalizationMethodDescription(Ref)`, `CV`, `NCV`, `≡_UNM`, `NormalizationInvariant[*]`, `NormalizationFixSpec`; avoids “map” wording (esp. `Map`); κ‑notation is retired.
- [ ] **CN routing:** uses `CN_Spec.comparability.mode` and the `CN_Spec.normalization` surface; does not embed “shadow CN-spec”.
- [ ] **Fail-closed:** eligibility is tri-state and never coerces unknown to pass.
- [ ] **Lawfulness classes declared:** method class is one of `{ratio:scale, interval:affine, ordinal:monotone, nominal:categorical, tabular:LUT(+uncertainty)}` and the instance's validity window is named.
- [ ] **No indicator conflation:** does not treat NCV as automatically implying indicator status.
- [ ] **Relation and reuse discipline:** every NCV names the method and CN-Spec editions, bearer, scope/window, reference or comparison basis, evidence and intended comparison; cite a Bridge, kind relation, or plane relation only when the use actually relies on it, with any supported loss on `R`/`R_eff`.
- [ ] **Quotient/fix discipline:** if a representative is required, `NormalizationFix` is declared; otherwise quotient semantics remain abstract.
- [ ] **Auditability:** method and CN-Spec editions, bearer, scope/window, basis, evidence, intended comparison, and any actually used relation are recorded as refs or pins.
- [ ] **No shadow writers:** downstream consumers cite the exact method, basis, and evidence editions and do not re-author them or replace them with a generic registry.
- [ ] **P2W awareness (when used in flows):** missing/stale inputs lead to explicit `FreshnessRequest` emissions (planned via P2W), not silent coercion.
- [ ] **SlotKind discipline:** SlotKind tokens reuse the CHR SlotKind lexicon where applicable; UNM‑specific SlotKinds are docked into the suite lexicon before use (no ad‑hoc drift).
- [ ] **No proxy registry:** no registry key stands in for the exact normalized values, method, CN-Spec, bearer, scope/window, basis, evidence, intended comparison, or actually obtaining relation.

### A.19.UNM:8 - Common Anti‑Patterns and How to Avoid Them

1) **Hidden normalization inside scoring or selection**
   Avoid by using `CN_Spec.comparability.mode` and explicit UNM use.

2) **“NCV ⇒ indicator” shortcut**
   Avoid by treating indicatorization as UINDM policy, not a byproduct of normalization.

3) **“We normalized” without declaring invariants**
   Avoid by naming `NormalizationInvariant[*]` and exposing `≡_UNM`.

4) **Reusing a normalized value after its basis changed**
   Avoid by checking the exact bearer, method and CN-Spec editions, scope/window, comparison basis, evidence, and intended use again; cite a Bridge, kind relation, or plane relation only when the new use actually relies on it.

5) **Choosing a representative implicitly**
   Avoid by either keeping quotient objects abstract or declaring `NormalizationFix`.

6) **Using “map/mapping/Map” language as if it were harmless**
   Avoid by using “normalization / re‑parameterization under invariants” and by keeping `Map` for its specialized FPF meaning.

7) **Treating UNM outputs as comparable beyond their declared bearer, basis, scope/window, or reference plane**
   Avoid by keeping comparison local to the recorded premises. Where a conclusion depends on another source-local meaning, bearer kind, or plane, cite the exact obtaining relation and its loss; otherwise constitute a new normalization result or fail closed.

8) **Re-authoring method, basis, or evidence anchors downstream**
   Avoid by citing the exact editioned method, basis, and evidence anchors as refs; a downstream pattern neither rewrites them nor replaces them with a generic registry.

### A.19.UNM:9 - Consequences

**Benefits**
- Makes “normalize-then-compare” a first-class governance choice.
- Centralizes governing-pattern assignment, improving usability and reducing drift.
- Supports evolvability: method families can evolve via packs/extensions without mutating the mechanism surface.
- Prevents silent inadmissibility (unit, scale, and plane errors) by fail-closed guards.

**Costs**
- Requires explicit declarations (method instance, invariants, validity window, evidence pins).
- Some workflows must learn quotient/fix thinking (a conceptual overhead).

### A.19.UNM:10 - Rationale

UNM is designed as a **minimal canonical semantic surface**:
- Enough structure to prevent illegal comparisons and hidden transformations.
- Explicit routing in CN-frame so normalization is governance, not an algorithmic trick.
- Evidence/calibration are delegated to MM‑CHR to avoid redefining measurement meaning.
- Exact bearer, basis, scope/window and intended-use checks prevent accidental global normalization; actual Bridge, kind, and plane relations are cited only when a conclusion relies on them.

This balances evolvability (methods evolve) with didactic usability (one place to read what UNM is).

### A.19.UNM:11 - SoTA‑Echoing (post‑2015 practice alignment)

UNM does not prescribe algorithms, but it is designed to wire in SoTA normalization families via `NormalizationMethodDescriptionRef` + evidence pins (typically shipped as `G.2` SoTA packs and wired via `GPatternExtension` modules, not as mutations of UNM’s surface). Examples of post‑2015 method families that often appear as evidence-backed normalization candidates (domain-dependent):
- **SoTA ≠ popular.** Method families enter UNM through `G.2` claim structures + edition pins + evidence pins; “widely used” is not a validity claim by itself.
- **Calibration of probabilistic coordinates** (e.g., temperature scaling; multiclass calibration families such as Dirichlet calibration).
  *Typical citations:* Guo et al., 2017; Kull et al., 2019.
- **Shift-/validity-region-aware normalization** where “validity window/region” is explicit and shift detection enters as *evidence*, not as hidden branching.
  *Typical citations:* Lipton et al., 2018 (shift estimation); Ovadia et al., 2019 (uncertainty under shift) — as evidence motifs.
- **Order-preserving transforms** for ordinal regimes (normalization constrained to monotone transforms; scale lawfulness forbids arithmetic).
  *Typical citations:* modern monotonic modeling toolkits (post‑2017) used as *method families*, not as silent arithmetic.
- **Set-valued / uncertainty-aware normalization outputs** where uncertainty is preserved as a first-class outcome (tri‑state guards + set-valued uncertainty carriers, rather than coerced point values).
  *Typical citations:* conformal-style families (post‑2018+) used as evidence/uncertainty carriers.

SoTA is connected as **wiring** (packs/extensions) while UNM’s surface remains stable.
