## A.15.5 - Work-Entry Readiness and Full-Kit Preparation

> **Type:** Architectural (A)
> **Status:** Stable
> **Normativity:** Normative unless marked informative

**At a glance.** Use A.15.5 to judge whether one exact intended performance named in a `U.WorkPlan` and `PlanItem` satisfies one exact work-entry readiness criterion at a stated evaluation time. Separately performed preparation or checking Work applies that criterion to exact current plan, filling, resource, assignment, commitment, permission, source, and gate inputs. Persist the local result as a C.2.1 episteme only when another use must rely on it; readiness makes neither the target Work nor any input fact obtain.

**Use this when.** Use this pattern when a team is about to commit, release, launch, or admit intended work and needs to know whether the needed inputs, currentness refs, publication refs, resources, planned fillers, constraints, and gate conditions are ready enough for that work entry.

**Primary EntityOfConcern.** The persisted readiness result is one C.2.1 episteme whose exact EntityOfConcern is the `U.WorkPlan` being judged. Its ClaimGraph designates the relevant `PlanItem`, intended performance, criterion, evaluated facts, verdict, and applicability window. Preserve the plan's exact intended-work kind or work-family classification when that distinction is current; it remains ClaimGraph content and does not instantiate a dated `U.Work`. The plan names the target `U.Method`; cite a separately constituted `U.MethodDescription` episteme only when the readiness criterion or planned use relies on that exact description edition. The intended-performance designator, intended-work kind, plan item, method, and description are not a dated target `U.Work` occurrence.

**First output.** One readable work-entry readiness result naming the WorkPlan, PlanItem and intended performance; criterion; checking Work; local readiness value; every input proposition and qualification interval used; reliance window; and stop or recheck condition. Planned fillings, resources, assignments, commitments, current permission facts, gate decisions, provenance, and assurance remain inputs or neighboring claims defined and tested separately; they retain their own identities, while any persisted readiness-result episteme cites them in its ClaimGraph.

**Ordinary route.** Name the exact WorkPlan, PlanItem, intended performance, any current intended-work kind, criterion, and evaluation time. Perform and identify the checking Work when the check actually occurs; apply the criterion only to its named current inputs; return `ready`, `readyWithKnownGaps`, `notReady`, or `unknown` with the reliance window and stop or recheck condition. Stop there unless a separate receiver actually needs a persisted result episteme, gate decision, permission result, performed target Work, provenance path, or assurance claim.

When degraded support, handoff, or continuation-state evidence can change work entry, use the present-WorkPlan branch of `A.15.8` to test the proposed performer, support, and state configuration, then return here with its bounded result. Ordinary full-kit checking does not require `A.15.8`.

**What this buys.** A team can decide the next bounded move—start no work yet, prepare an exact missing input, recheck, or submit declared checks to a gate—without turning a plan, green label, commitment, reservation, permission fact, or preparation activity into target Work or into one all-purpose readiness object.

**Not this pattern when.** Use `A.15.2` for the work plan itself, `A.15.3` for planned slot fillers, `A.15.1` for dated performed work, `A.21` for gate decisions, `A.15.4` only when a reliance appearance is already being used as a reason for work or reliance before the subject pattern slot, relation, or project-side reference is named, `B.1.6` for resource aggregation after work, `E.18` for transformation-flow structure, and `E.18.1` for P2W carry-through from accepted problem-side material.

### A.15.5:1 - Problem Frame

Teams often say that work is "ready", "full-kitted", "committed", "green", "released", or "good to start." Those words can point to different FPF values: an intended WorkPlan, a PlanItem baseline, a performed preparation activity, a gate decision, a source-currentness relation, resource availability, or resulting performed work.

`A.15.5` gives the readiness question and its local result one place without importing a management framework object as an FPF kind. Readiness is pre-work-entry unless a recheck after launch or post-launch variance claim is explicitly current. A readiness claim may cite preparation or checking Work, but it is neither that Work nor the target performed Work.

### A.15.5:2 - Problem

Without one explicit local work-entry readiness claim and result semantics:

1. Full-kit preparation becomes an attractive umbrella for planning, source relations, gate passage, and performed work.
2. A green tile or ready label is treated as a `GateDecisionResult`.
3. Declaration-local planned-filling content inside the WorkPlan is overread as evidence that the planned values were actually prepared or used.
4. Resource readiness is confused with resource consumption.
5. A committed item becomes "done" by position in a board, not by a separately established completion claim about dated `U.Work`.

### A.15.5:3 - Forces

| Force | Pressure |
| --- | --- |
| Work-entry speed | Teams need a short readiness result before work entry. |
| Open-world discipline | An input omitted from one criterion is not thereby absent; an unavailable required fact returns `unknown` unless an applicable explicit failure condition is established. |
| Plan and work split | A readiness claim can cite intended work and performed preparation or checking Work without becoming performed target Work. |
| Gate separation | An A.21 gate may consume a readiness result as a declared check input, but readiness does not publish a `GateDecisionResult`. |
| Full-kit usefulness | Full-kit thinking is valuable when it states what must be known, prepared, reserved, or checked before work starts. |

### A.15.5:4 - Solution

Represent readiness as one domain-local result claim about exact plan content, not as a root U-kind, imported management object, generic container, or default relation occurrence. When persistence matters, C.2.1 identifies the result episteme; A.15.5 supplies the readiness-specific criterion and result-value semantics only.

**E.24.UK settlement.** This pattern introduces no root `U.Readiness`, root `U.Move`, imported TameFlow `MOVE` kind, `FullKitCondition` object, independent readiness entity, or default readiness relation. Exact plans, plan components, methods, performed Work, resources, assignments, commitments, permission results, gate decisions, evidence, provenance, and assurance retain their subject patterns.

#### A.15.5:4.1 - One work-entry readiness claim

Start with one ordinary sentence:

> At evaluation time T, checking Work W applied criterion C to intended performance I in PlanItem J of WorkPlan P and returned readiness value R for use through window V; stop or recheck when Q occurs.

`P` is one exact `U.WorkPlan` episteme. `J` and `I` are declaration-local plan content, not existing future entities. `C` is one exact criterion episteme whose applicability to this plan item and evaluation time is current. `W` is one separately identified dated `U.Work` occurrence with its performer system, covering assignment, enacted method, extent, and any actual A.6.1 bindings or direct participants required by the check. `R` is a local `ReadinessResultValue`, not a gate decision, permission, commitment, work occurrence, or universal result kind.

The local value family is:

- `ready` — every input required by C is determined and satisfies C for V;
- `readyWithKnownGaps` — C explicitly admits the named gaps for this exact bounded use, every non-waived input is determined and satisfied, and V plus the stop condition expose the remaining risk;
- `notReady` — an applicable failure or closure condition in C is determined for this case; and
- `unknown` — one required fact, currentness result, predicate, or applicability basis cannot be determined. Absence of an assertion or persisted episteme is not by itself `notReady`.

When the answer must persist, one C.2.1 result episteme states this complete local claim. Its exact `EntityOfConcern` is P; its ClaimGraph names J, I, C, W, R, evaluated input facts, evaluation time, V, and the stop or recheck condition under one effective `U.ReferenceScheme`. C.2.1 supplies episteme identity. A.15.5 adds no second readiness identity, independent readiness U-kind, or default readiness relation occurrence. If repeated predicate semantics are needed, use A.6.RCD's reusable-predicate branch; open relation-kind admission only for a named receiver that must distinguish readiness occurrences as such.

The result episteme reports the check. It is not performed target work, and the checking Work is not the result. If a current claim says that exact checking or preparation Work first constituted that episteme, recover only that local entity-identity inception claim under A.15.PROD; A.15.5 does not infer or copy it.

#### A.15.5:4.2 - Readiness criterion and full-kit inputs

Use one exact readiness criterion when the entry question depends on what must be known, prepared, reserved, gathered, communicated, assigned, or pinned before work starts. The criterion states:

- the exact WorkPlan and its present EntityOfConcern, PlanItem, intended-performance designator, any exact intended-work target and intended outcome or value claim current in the plan, any current intended-work kind or work-family classification, target `U.Method`, evaluation time, and applicability window it judges;
- each required positive or negative predicate, the allowed named gaps if any, and the rule for `ready`, `readyWithKnownGaps`, `notReady`, and `unknown`;
- which changed fact, expired interval, new conflict, source revision, or resource or assignment change ends reliance; and
- the stop, degraded-use, preparation, or recheck action for each non-ready result.

Full-kit thinking supplies a recognition palette for inputs; it is not a `FullKitCondition` object or a field bundle. Open only the input claims that C actually consumes:

1. exact A.15.2 plan content and any A.15.3 planned fillings, with the declaration member and conditions that give each filling meaning;
2. current information, source-currentness, publication, measurement, evidence, or assurance claims under their subject patterns;
3. exact resource-availability or reservation claims, intended performer Systems and local system-role-kind conditions, any already obtaining occurrence of an exact directly declared `U.SystemRoleAssignment` species when C requires an assignment, capability threshold or fit result, and exact commitment claims when C uses them; plus any exact current work-in-progress or load and flow-policy claims under the pattern that defines their counted work, boundary, threshold, and qualification window;
4. separately performed preparation Work and readiness-checking Work, each with its exact performer system, obtaining assignment, enacted method, temporal extent, and actual direct participants or A.6.1 bindings;
5. exact prospective A.2.8.PER grant, non-prohibition, or conflict facts and their qualification windows when permission is current; and
6. an exact A.21 `GateDecisionResult` only when a current A.21 profile application governs the declared check applications and their mappings to that decision. The gate decision remains a separate result.

An exact post-launch variance or recheck result may enter only after the target Work is actual and only through the measurement, comparison, evaluation, resource, temporal, acceptance, or other pattern that defines that exact result. Name the target Work, comparison or evaluation rule, local result, qualification window, and subject pattern. It may trigger or inform an explicitly marked recheck; it neither proves that readiness held before entry nor rewrites the earlier readiness result.
For each input, name the subject pattern, exact proposition or relation occurrence, and the interval or currentness result on which this readiness check relies. A generic input, evidence, context, resource, assignment, or policy reference supplies none of those facts. Omission says only that the current criterion did not consume that input; it does not prove absence.

Full-kit preparation can include gathering information, coordinating intended performer Systems and local system-role-kind conditions, producing a missing source `U.Episteme` or source publication, reserving a resource, pinning a planned filling, or creating shared understanding. Those activities are `U.Work` only when actually performed. The plan can state them before occurrence; the readiness claim may cite them after occurrence; neither object becomes the other.

For every cited preparation or readiness-checking Work occurrence, first recover each actual performer's A.13 core for the action and independently admit the exact dated `U.Work` under A.15.1 from its performance history, at least one actual `enactsMethod` relation, temporal extent, and at least one obtaining locally declared containing-system relation. Only when the readiness claim also needs precise assignment-bound attribution, establish F.6 afterward through the same obtaining A.13 assignment and keep its declared species, participants, holder, coverage, and exact Work-assignment link recoverable. Name another enacted Method, boundary, direct participant relation, or A.6.1 binding only when the readiness claim uses it. The system performs the work; an assignment, plan, method description, checklist, criterion, readiness result, evidence path, or dashboard does not. A planned preparation task remains A.15.2 content until the occurrence facts obtain.

**Boundary with planned fillers and appearance-based reliance.** A missing planned value stays with A.15.3 as a planned-filling baseline or with the subject pattern when an evidence, currentness, publication, gate, permission, or assurance relation is already known. Use A.15.4 only when a reliance appearance, such as a dashboard label, copied approval, publication face, or credential view, is being used as the reason to treat the readiness or work-reliance claim as carried before that subject pattern relation has been recovered.

#### A.15.5:4.3 - Commitment and Launch Boundary

Keep commitment facts separate from the readiness value. The criterion may consume exact current commitment claims and their qualification intervals, but `ready`, `readyWithKnownGaps`, `notReady`, or `unknown` does not mean `committed`, institute a commitment, discharge one, or authorize entry. State the practical next move—stop, prepare, probe, seek a separately governed commitment, submit to a gate, launch only under its separately satisfied entry conditions, or recheck—as the result's bounded use and return condition, not as another ontic status family. The older labels `readyForProbe`, `readyForCommitment`, `committed`, `blocked`, and `requiresGateDecision` therefore resolve to a local readiness value plus an explicit next move, commitment claim, stop, or gate question; they are not additional `ReadinessResultValue` members.

Use `A.2.8.PER` when a pre-entry readiness criterion consumes permission material. Name each exact value and its own qualification: a current `GrantedPermissionRelation@Context` occurrence with its beneficiary, permitted-action specification, `U.ClaimScope`, and `validityWindow`; a distinct `NonProhibitionFinding@Context` with its frame and `evaluationWindow`; and any `PermissionNormConflictFinding@Context` with its `overlapWindow`, disposition, and, when settled, the subject pattern's resolution result and `effectiveWindow`. Non-prohibition is not a grant, a grant does not resolve conflict, and an unresolved current conflict blocks or degrades the readiness use under the criterion. `PermissionExerciseRelation@Context` and `NonViolationFinding@Context` require already dated actual work: cite either only as evidence about a different exact Work occurrence, or in an explicitly marked post-launch recheck after the target Work is actual, with its own `exerciseInterval` or `evaluationWindow`. Neither retrospective result proves current grant, capability, future exercise or non-violation, readiness, gate passage, or target-work performance. The readiness result institutes no permission, exercises none, resolves no conflict, and turns no non-prohibition finding into a grant. Use A.21 only when a current profile application governs the declared check applications and their mappings to a distinct `GateDecisionResult`. Keep `DecisionLogRef`, scope, currentness result, and effective window recoverable for this readiness use. A readiness badge, green tile, full-kit label, or commitment board position is not gate passage; gate passage creates none of the permission objects.

#### A.15.5:4.4 - Relation to A.15 Family

| Current claim | Subject pattern |
| --- | --- |
| Intended target work and horizon | `A.15.2 U.WorkPlan`. |
| Planned fillings before work | A.15.3 declaration-local planned-filling content inside the exact `U.WorkPlan`. |
| Preparation activity that actually happened | `A.15.1 U.Work`. |
| Target work that actually happened | `A.15.1 U.Work`. |
| Readiness before work entry | `A.15.5` local result claim, persisted as a C.2.1 episteme when needed. |
| Resource budgets or reservations before work | `A.15.2` plan content plus the exact predicate and source for the current resource-availability or reservation claim; A.15.5 cites the current claim only when the criterion consumes it. |
| Resource consumption by work | `B.1.6` plus `A.15.1`. |

#### A.15.5:4.5 - Relation to P2W and Pattern Use

When `E.18.1` carries accepted problem-side material to a readiness question, `E.18.1` names that carry-through relation and cites `A.15.5` for the readiness result. When a user needs to know which pattern to use before readiness is current, use `E.11.PUR`.

### A.15.5:5 - Archetypal Grounding - Worked Slices

#### A.15.5:5.1 - Fixture deformation test

**Situation.** An accepted cooling-fixture ProblemCard has been carried through E.18.1 into `WorkPlan-LAB-043 : U.WorkPlan`; that P2W carry-through creates neither readiness nor target Work. Its `PlanItem-TEST-043` designates possible future performance `planned-fixture-deformation-test-043`, classifies the intended work as fixture-deformation testing under the plan's current scheme, selects `FixtureDeformationTestMethod-E2 : U.Method`, and relies on `FixtureDeformationTestProcedure-E5 : U.MethodDescription` only for the setup limits stated in that edition. The plan also carries declaration-local planned-filling rows `SFI-043` for specimen and instrument choices, planned resource reservation `FixtureBayReservation-043`, and intended performer-system and `FixtureTestTechnicianSystemRole` conditions. The rows have no identity outside this WorkPlan. None is target test Work.

`FixtureTestEntryCriterion-E2` requires, for the proposed start window, a resolved specimen identity, heat-flow invariant claim, boundary-condition plan, sensor-calibration result, selected fixture-drawing edition, resource-availability claim, and fixture-test-technician assignment, all current for this use. The assignment basis is explicit once: `FixtureTestTechnicianAssignment` is a directly declared `U.SystemRoleAssignment` species. It defines the holder and assigned-kind positions, uses `FixtureTestSystemRoleKindDomain`, requires `FixtureTestTechnicianSystemRole`, and applies to this laboratory test. Its obtaining occurrence `FixtureTestTechnicianAssignment-043` has `FixtureTechnicianSystem-043` as holder and covers the proposed start window. The A.15.3 rows preserve only the planned specimen and instrument choices. The calibration result, its A.10 evidence path and currentness result, and the E.17 drawing-edition publication use remain separate inputs. The criterion returns `notReady` when a required input is known to be expired or unresolved; unavailable facts return `unknown`. Any input revision, assignment gap, resource loss, or start-window change ends reliance and requires recheck.

`CalibrationCurrentnessCheck-043 : U.Work` was performed by `LabMetrologySystem-2 : U.System` under obtaining `RA-LabMetrology-2-E7`, enacted `CalibrationCurrentnessCheckMethod-E1`, and determined that the cited sensor-calibration result expired before the proposed start. Separately, `FixtureEntryReadinessCheck-043 : U.Work` was performed by `LabOperationsCoordinatorSystem-1 : U.System` under obtaining `RA-LabOperationsCoordinator-1-E4`, enacted `FixtureEntryReadinessEvaluationMethod-E2`, and applied the criterion to the exact plan inputs.

The C.2.1 episteme `FixtureTestEntryReadinessResult-E1`, whose exact EntityOfConcern is `WorkPlan-LAB-043`, states `notReady` for `PlanItem-TEST-043`: the calibration result is expired and the fixture-drawing edition remains unresolved. Its stop is `do not start planned-fixture-deformation-test-043`; its return condition is `obtain a current calibration result, select the drawing edition, and rerun the readiness check`. The preparation and checking Work occurred; the target test did not. No A.21 gate decision or A.2.8.PER permission result follows from this readiness result.

**What changes in practice.** The team stops the target test, assigns the two named preparation moves, and reruns the exact criterion after their inputs are current; it neither turns the existing plan into performed Work nor asks a gate or permission label to stand in for the missing facts.

#### A.15.5:5.2 - Documentation Repair Probe

Situation: an assisting agent can run a reversible documentation probe to find source-currentness gaps.

For the probe itself, apply one exact readiness criterion to its WorkPlan, using the designated declaration-local PlanItem content that the criterion needs, and return the local readiness value with its relied-on inputs, window, and recheck condition. If the probe is actually run, first recover the precise performer System's A.13 core for that action and independently admit the dated occurrence as `U.Work` under A.15.1 from its performance history, enacted Method, extent, and containing-System relation. Add F.6 afterward only when the target repair-readiness account also consumes precise assignment-bound attribution through the same obtaining A.13 assignment; otherwise leave F.6 unopened. Then run a separate readiness check for the target repair. The claims about the probe plan, probe readiness result, performed probe, and target-repair readiness result are four distinct claims.

#### A.15.5:5.3 - Release screen with separate readiness, gate, and permission windows

At `10:00`, `ReleaseReadinessCheck-12 : U.Work` evaluates `ReleasePlan-E7`, `PlanItem-Deploy-12`, and `ReleaseEntryCriterion-E3`. The persisted result says `ready` for reliance only in `[10:00, 10:30)` and requires recheck after any source, resource, assignment, permission, or gate-input change.

At `10:05`, the current A.21 application of profile `Release-Core-E4` consumes that readiness result through one identified `GateCheckApplicationResult`, cited by its `GateCheckRef`, among the complete effective check set. The gate returns a `GateDecisionResult` with `decisionValue=pass` for `[10:05, 10:20)`; `DecisionLogRef=ReleaseGateLog-12` cites the separate log recording that result. That gate result is not the readiness result and does not institute permission.

Separately, exact A.2.8.PER `GrantedPermissionRelation@Context` occurrence `DeployGrant-12` covers the named beneficiary and deployment action for `[09:00, 11:00)`. `DeployNonProhibitionFinding-E2` reports `nonProhibited` from its named current frame, explicitly complete for this use, in evaluation window `[10:00, 10:15)`; it is not the grant. A `PermissionNormConflictFinding@Context`, if an incompatible current norm is established over the same content and window, would be a third permission-side input and an unresolved disposition would stop the use. A policy that requires readiness, gate passage, a current grant, and the frame-relative non-prohibition result may rely on those distinct inputs at `10:10`; it must re-evaluate the relevant branch when any window ends or a conflict appears. None of them proves that deployment Work occurred. A.15.1 identifies that Work only after its dated occurrence basis obtains.

If a dashboard shows green but the exact readiness result or its reliance window, the current A.21 profile application and `DecisionLogRef`, or the required permission value and qualification window cannot be recovered, the display remains a cue, an appearance-based reliance question, or a prompt to open the exact A.10 evidence-provenance and applicable currentness question for the claim being relied on. It is not readiness, evidence sufficiency, gate passage, authorization, or performed work by appearance.

### A.15.5:6 - Bias-Annotation

- **Ready-label bias.** A green tile, ready label, release screen, or commitment board position can look stronger than the recoverable claim. Recover whether the current object is readiness, appearance-based reliance repair under `A.15.4`, gate decision, work authorization, or performed work.
- **Full-kit umbrella bias.** Full-kit preparation is useful, but it can hide planned baselines, performed preparation work, resource readiness, source currentness, and target work. Keep each current value in its subject pattern.
- **Baseline-as-actuals bias.** Planned fillers and readiness references do not prove launch values, performed values, variance, or results.

### A.15.5:7 - Conformance Checklist

| ID | A conforming readiness use... | Check |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `CC-A15.5-1` | names the exact WorkPlan, PlanItem, intended performance, criterion, and evaluation time. | The readiness result cannot float free of the plan content and bounded entry question it judges. |
| `CC-A15.5-2` | separates readiness from performed work. | No target `U.Work` occurrence is asserted unless dated work evidence is current. |
| `CC-A15.5-3` | separates full-kit inputs from preparation and checking Work. | Cite preparation or checking as actual only through one exact dated `U.Work`, performer system, obtaining assignment, enacted Method, extent, and required actual bindings. |
| `CC-A15.5-4` | cites planned baselines without rewriting them. | A.15.3 planned-filling rows remain declaration-local content inside the exact WorkPlan. |
| `CC-A15.5-5` | keeps gate decisions in A.21. | Readiness labels do not create `GateDecisionResult` without A.21 fields. |
| `CC-A15.5-6` | keeps resource readiness and resource aggregation distinct. | Planned reservations and actual consumption are not merged. |
| `CC-A15.5-7` | states stop, degraded-use, or recheck condition. | The reader can tell whether to stop, probe, commit, launch, or name a missing value under its subject pattern. |
| `CC-A15.5-8` | keeps prospective and retrospective permission inputs temporally typed and non-productive. | A current grant uses its `validityWindow`; non-prohibition uses its `evaluationWindow`; conflict uses its `overlapWindow` and any subject-pattern resolution `effectiveWindow`. Exercise and non-violation appear only for different dated Work or an explicit post-launch recheck, with their own intervals. None proves another permission value, readiness, gate passage, capability, or target-work performance. |
| `CC-A15.5-9` | keeps the readiness result, domain-local inputs, provenance, assurance, and any inception claim under their subject patterns. | C.2.1 identifies the readiness-result episteme; each measurement, evaluation, resource, permission, gate, or other input keeps its own result algebra; use A.10 for provenance and state any assurance result separately under B.3, and A.15.PROD is opened only for a separately current local entity-identity inception claim. |

### A.15.5:8 - Common Anti-Patterns and How to Avoid Them

| Anti-pattern | Why it fails | Better use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Ready label as authorization | A label is treated as permission, conflict resolution, work authorization, or gate passage. | Use `A.2.8.PER` for the exact permission/conflict result, A.21 for gate decision, or A.15.4 when a reliance appearance is being used as a reason for work or reliance before the subject pattern slot, relation, or project-side reference is named. |
| Full kit as work done | Prepared inputs are treated as target work completion. | Record preparation work separately and target work only when it occurs. |
| Baseline as actuals | Planned slot fillers are treated as launch or performed values. | Keep planned fillers in A.15.3 and record variance after work. |
| MOVE imported as kind | TameFlow source wording becomes an FPF object. | Recover intended work, commitment, readiness, gate, preparation work, or performed work under FPF patterns. |

### A.15.5:9 - Consequences

Benefits:

- Teams can inspect work-entry readiness without flattening plan, preparation, gate, resource, and performed-work claims.
- The adapted pre-entry Full-Kitting distinctions supply a recognition palette for a local readiness criterion; neither TameFlow nor its source vocabulary governs FPF readiness.
- Gate and work evidence remain auditable because readiness only cites them when they are current.

Costs:

- Some "ready" claims become incomplete until the target work, missing inputs, and stop condition are named.
- A full-kit check may expose missing preparation Work or inputs that need their own plan, subject-pattern currentness, evidence-provenance, publication, resource, or assignment claims.

### A.15.5:10 - Rationale

The readiness question is practical and recurrent: should this intended work enter the work boundary now? FPF already has the kinds needed to answer it. One local criterion and result claim keep the answer inspectable without collapsing the plan, its inputs, the checking Work, gate, permission, or target Work into one object.

The local result is deliberately dependent on exact inputs defined in their subject patterns. It preserves the `U.WorkPlan`, its A.15.3 declaration-local planned-filling content, `U.Work`, A.21 gate decisions, resource claims, and the A.15.4 appearance-based reliance question as distinct values while giving the practitioner one inspectable answer. It may consume an immediate A.15.4 disposition within the same use; only a separately persisted C.2.1 claim is citable later. It does not turn every missing input into a source problem or merge the cited inputs with the result episteme; their references remain claim content.

### A.15.5:11 - SoTA-Echoing

| Source family | Currentness and bounded source use | Local adoption |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Steve Tendon, [*The Book of TameFlow: Theory of Constraints Applied to Knowledge-Work Management*](https://leanpub.com/tameflow), current Leanpub edition accessed 2026-08-27 | Adapt only the pre-entry Full-Kitting distinctions used to recognize minimum outcome or value, target scope, commitment, WIP pressure, and preparation inputs. Reject source `MOVE` or Full-Kitting as an FPF kind or universal readiness ontology; the source remains scoped to knowledge-work management. | Use the adapted distinctions only as inputs to an FPF-local readiness criterion and result; keep WorkPlan, PlanItem, gate, preparation Work, resource, assignment, permission, and performed-Work claims under their subject patterns. |
| Current A.15 work-family settlement | Current internal governing basis for intended work, planned baseline, dated performed Work, and readiness boundaries. | Reuse the split directly; readiness cites but does not replace those values. |
| Current A.21 gate-publication discipline | Current internal governing basis for gate decisions and their publication. | Readiness may feed a gate, but gate passage belongs to A.21. |

Correct a factual citation or publication-status label in its row without reopening the readiness action when the used distinction and limit are unchanged. Reopen only the TameFlow row and its Full-Kitting-dependent recognition and action passages in §§4.2 and 9 if a source-edition change alters a used distinction. Reopen the affected A.15.5 boundary if the current FPF A.15 or A.21 work/readiness settlement changes it. Another example, prestige change, or unused source-edition change does not reopen the whole pattern.

### A.15.5:12 - Relations

- **Builds on:** `A.15`, `A.15.1`, `A.15.2`, `A.15.3`, `A.15.4`, `A.21`, `B.1.6`, `E.18`, `E.18.1`, and `E.24`; consumes current `A.2.8.PER` grant/non-prohibition/conflict refs as prospective inputs, and exercise/non-violation refs only as evidence about different dated work or in an explicit post-launch recheck after target work is actual.
- **Coordinates with:** `E.11.PUR` for recommended pattern use before readiness is selected, `E.10.MOVE` for readiness wording repair, `C.32.P2S` when readiness prepares work that realizes architecture-selected structures, and `A.3.4.P` when workflow or process wording is primarily transformation-situation wording.
- **Does not replace:** target `U.WorkPlan`, its declaration-local planned-filling content, `U.Work`, `GateDecisionResult`, the A.15.4 reliance question and note, resource aggregation, or transformation-flow structure.

### A.15.5:End
