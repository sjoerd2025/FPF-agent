## Decide Whether FPF Fits

Use FPF when ordinary discussion is no longer enough to keep work coherent. Typical signs:

- several teams, experts, tools, or AI agents share reasoning about the same work;
- the real-world test is slow, expensive, noisy, risky, or politically hard to repeat;
- different readers need different reports, dashboards, explanations, or decisions about the same underlying work;
- names, roles, responsibilities, options, evidence, or quality criteria are starting to blur;
- the team needs a current view of possible approaches, not just one recommendation;
- a decision is small enough to make now but important enough to leave a durable reason.

FPF is probably too heavy when the task is small, feedback is fast and cheap, the vocabulary is already stable, the decision will not be reused or audited, and a quick answer is enough.

FPF is mainly useful for people who have to keep difficult work understandable across boundaries:

- engineers and systems engineers working with complex products or operations;
- researchers building claims for inspection or reuse by others;
- platform and AI teams coordinating humans, models, tools, and approvals;
- safety, assurance, compliance, and regulatory leads who need visible evidence and responsibility boundaries;
- managers and product leaders comparing options, budgets, risks, and delivery promises without hiding trade-offs.

There are three common ways to use FPF:

1. Human-only: use it as a writing and review discipline for meetings, notes, decisions, and technical documents.
2. Mixed team: use it to keep specialists, managers, safety leads, and AI assistants aligned around the same work.
3. AI-assisted: attach or index the specification, ask for plain-language project help first, and use pattern names only when they make the answer easier to check.

FPF can help with the evidence and decision questions that remain as AI becomes more capable. AI can generate fluent options quickly, but projects still need to decide what counts as evidence, which option is being compared, who may rely on an answer, when a claim is stale, what remains only a guess, and what work is actually authorized. FPF helps make those boundaries explicit before a confident answer becomes an expensive mistake.

Core ideas in plain language:

- first name the project object under concern; FPF calls it a holon when its actual construction supports treatment as a whole with parts and as a possible part of a larger whole; use `A.1` to check a particular candidate;
- local teams may use local meanings; boundary-crossing work makes the translation relation explicit;
- the project object itself, its description, a dashboard about it, a decision about it, and the work done to change it are not the same;
- architecture is structure of that holon or project object in a context, not the diagram, document, approval, or plan about it;
- serious architecture work can move from problem pressure to candidate structures, selected structures, decisions, method and work, actual structures, and feedback;
- when the current question is which reusable way of doing changes, produces, derives, selects, controls, or preserves the project object under stated conditions, inspect `A.3.1 U.Method`; a strategy name, procedure text, program, plan, dated run, mechanism, or evidence record does not answer that method question by its label or form;
- to decide whether setting up and applying a selected apparatus, such as a model, is worth the cost for one use, inspect `C.19.2`; it tests the bounded application against the required result and guarantee. Use `C.39` when a missing obtaining explanation must be developed, or `C.40` when usable material needs variation and examination. Use `C.18` for archive or front claims, and `C.11` when two or more eligible alternatives make a local choice current;
- when a clear engineering claim produces a wrong action, identity, dependence, obtaining, responsibility, or projection consequence, inspect `A.7.1`; when current FPF uses produce incompatible consequences for the same receiving claim and scope, inspect `A.7.2`. In either case, keep the method episteme, admitted performer, dated work, the claim-specific result returned by the applicable pattern, and one result episteme distinct: the local disposition is a value in that result, not its kind, and `A.7.2` need not converge;
- when an accepted C.22.2 `ProblemCard` episteme must remain usable while the project selects a method, prepares or performs work, interprets a result, branches, stops, or returns after a changed assumption, inspect `E.18.1 P2W Problem-to-Work Carry-Through`; it carries the accepted problem-side distinctions into one next value or relation returned by the pattern that answers the current question rather than prescribing one universal workflow;
- when route-like positions, relations, or constraints change which continuation remains possible, inspect `E.18.3`: begin with the concrete thing being transformed, two recognizable places or states, the proposed connection or guard, and the current continuation question. An ordinary provisional explanation may answer it or stop with the exact missing predicate or occurrence rule, missing case fact, or unavailable information. Recover exact A.22/E.18 qualification and a separate demonstrative-slice claim only when qualification, comparison, publication, or stronger reliance is current; if no branch, connection, or constraint changes the continuation question, keep an ordinary route description;
- keep several options alive until the comparison is clear enough to choose;
- say what "better" means before optimizing or scoring;
- make trust depend on evidence, freshness, scope, and intended use;
- publish different views for different readers without changing the underlying claim;
- when explanation, reader-facing ordering, or narrative rendering of selected source structure is current, state what structure is preserved, deliberately coarsened, abstracted, omitted, or lost; name the source-return condition and any stronger neighboring claim together with the concrete definition, constraint, test, method, evidence rule, or assurance rule it uses;
- use mathematics or formal models when they clarify what structure is preserved, what is lost, and what can be checked;
- build domain or local FPF-grounded frameworks as dependents of FPF Core, not as silent rewrites of the Core.
