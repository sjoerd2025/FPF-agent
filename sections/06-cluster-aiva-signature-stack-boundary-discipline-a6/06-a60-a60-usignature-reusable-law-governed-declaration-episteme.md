## A.6.0 - U.Signature - Reusable Law-Governed Declaration Episteme
> **Type:** Architectural (A)
> **Status:** Stable
> **Normativity:** Normative unless marked informative

**Pattern kind.** Ontic declaration pattern.

**Builds on.** A.7 for strict distinction, C.2.1 for episteme identity, C.3 for kinds, A.2.6 for claim scope, and A.6.5 for relation-slot discipline.

**Coordinates with.** A.6.REL for relation occurrences, A.6.1 for mechanisms, C.29 for mathematical-lens use, E.24.UK for durable U-kind admission, and E.24.PUB for publication.

### A.6.0:1 - Problem frame

An engineer has a vocabulary and a set of laws that need to remain stable across several dependent epistemes, such as model epistemes, method descriptions, and patterns. For example, a physical-modeling team needs one stable declaration of connector variables and conservation laws; a clinical team may need one stable definition of a dose-response predicate and its applicability without assuming that a dose-response relation kind has been admitted; and a formal-methods team needs one stable declaration of terms, inference forms, and invariants.

Use this pattern only when the thing being written or reused is itself a reusable declaration. A description, rule, policy, work plan, or specification does not qualify merely because it contains terms or constraints that recur elsewhere.

Before opening declaration fields, ask:

> What subject does this declaration cover? What values or results does it speak about? Which terms and laws may another use rely on? Where do those laws apply?

In FPF terms, the declaration is about one exact independently governed `EntityOfConcern`; `SubjectKind` and `RangedValueKind` name its declared subject and value range; `ResultKind` is added when a distinct result kind is current; and `Vocabulary`, `Laws`, and `Applicability` answer the remaining three questions. `U.Signature` is the episteme that carries this declaration. A relation kind opens the `RelationSignature` specialization; a mechanism family or formal calculus opens the corresponding A.6.1 or FormalSubstrate declaration; a method kind remains governed by A.3.1.

**Primary working reader and concern.** The reader is an engineer who authors or reuses a declaration and needs stable meaning, applicability, and typed reuse without authoring declaration or occurrence-identity apparatus beyond what the current use needs.

For the lightest useful declaration, name that subject through `SubjectKind` and `RangedValueKind`, add `ResultKind` when the result has another kind, and state `Vocabulary`, `Laws`, and `Applicability`. Add `SliceSet` and `ExtentRule` only when the same declared kind can have different members at different `U.ContextSlice` values and one named reuse needs that difference. Add A.6.5 SlotSpecs that declare the direct relation's participant meanings only inside a reusable `RelationSignature`; add operation argument and result declarations under A.6.1 when a mechanism declaration needs them. Add dependency declarations only when another signature relies on provided names or laws.

What goes wrong if this pattern is missed: content about later realization, evaluation, and publication accumulates inside the declaration. A later user cannot tell which names and laws are reusable, where they apply, or whether a changed implementation has changed the declaration.

What this buys: one identifiable declaration can be reused while later realizations and uses change under their own subject patterns.

Do not use this pattern merely to state that a direct relation obtains or that one work occurrence produced a result. State that claim directly. A maintenance work plan may reuse the words `connector` and `conservation law` while scheduling tasks; it remains a work plan unless its own claim content performs the reusable declaration job above. Construct a signature only when reusable declaration content is the current object.

### A.6.0:2 - Problem

FPF uses a signature when the episteme itself performs the reusable declaration job above: it identifies the declared subject and value or result range, supplies terms and laws another use may rely on, and says where those laws apply. Current non-exhaustive declaration families include theory or `A.3.3 U.Dynamics` epistemes, mechanism or `A.19.SelectorMechanism` declarations, method-kind declarations, formal substrates, and direct relation-kind declarations. Without one precise ontic:

1. the signature is confused with the entity it describes;
2. a relation declaration is confused with an obtaining relation occurrence;
3. applicability is reduced to an unexplained context label;
4. every declaration is forced into one rigid table-shaped publication form, even when a readable sentence is enough;
5. imported names and exported names remain implicit, so dependent declarations cannot be replayed safely.

The central problem is failure to keep the declaration episteme, its declared subject, the subject's occurrences, and later uses of the declaration as different objects.

### A.6.0:3 - Forces

| Force | Tension |
|---|---|
| Reuse and locality | Reusers need stable names and laws, but those claims are meaningful only under an effective reference scheme and bounded applicability. |
| Light first use and typed reuse | An ordinary receiving use starts from a direct assertion, while repeated use may need relation SlotSpecs under A.6.5, operation declarations under A.6.1, direct relation occurrence-identity rules, and independently governed dependencies. |
| Declaration and realization | Reusers need to assess a realization against declared laws, while the declaration, realizing entity, evaluation work, result episteme, and evidential reliance retain separate identities and direct relations. |
| Stable identity and evolution | Reusers need to know whether the same signature remains current, while a change in a realization alone leaves the signature unchanged. |
| Transdomain form and domain meaning | The same declaration form serves physical engineering, medicine, learning, and formal work while preserving their domain objects. |

### A.6.0:4 - Solution

Use `U.Signature` as the dependent durable U-kind for a reusable law-governed declaration episteme. Identify the episteme through its content, exact `EntityOfConcernRef`, and effective `U.ReferenceScheme`. Let the declaration state its vocabulary, laws, and applicability. Keep the declared subject and every later realization under their direct kinds and relations.

**Local signature mantra.** *Name the subject of the reusable declaration and the range of values or results it covers. List the terms another user may reuse, the laws that user must preserve, and where those laws apply. Add relation-participant declarations, operation inputs or results, slice-and-membership rules, or dependencies only when one named reuse calls for them. Keep implementations, evaluations, work, and publication outside the declaration.*

In FPF terms, the subject is identified by `EntityOfConcernRef`; `SubjectKind`, `RangedValueKind`, and optional `ResultKind` state the declared subject and range; and `Vocabulary`, `Laws`, and `Applicability` state the reusable terms, regularities, and use boundary. Add A.6.5 SlotSpecs only when a reusable `RelationSignature` must preserve the same participant meanings and types. Add A.6.1 operation arguments or results only for a current mechanism declaration. Add `SliceSet` and `ExtentRule` only when the same declared kind can have different members at selected context slices. Declare a dependency only when another signature actually relies on imported or provided names or laws. If the named reuse still works without an optional addition, leave that addition out. Implementations and realizations remain under A.6.1, evaluations under their direct evaluation patterns, work under A.15.1, and publication under E.24.PUB. The mantra is Plain recall wording. Apply A.22.CGUS only when one independently identified A.22 structure has local loci and at least two potential continuations defined by its selected relations and applied constraints.

#### A.6.0:4.1 - Admit and identify U.Signature

`U.Signature` is a same-individual dependent durable U-kind under `U.Episteme`. C.2.1 first identifies one episteme through one `EpistemeConstitutionRelation` by its complete claim content, exact independently governed `EntityOfConcern`, and effective `U.ReferenceScheme`. The claim graph and reference scheme are epistemic constituents; the `EntityOfConcern` is not. A.6.0 adds a stable membership condition and practitioner-facing declaration use to that already identified individual. It adds no second constitution relation, identity discriminator, assembly, composition rule, or holon test.

An already identified episteme is a `U.Signature` exactly when, under its effective `U.ReferenceScheme`, its complete identity-bearing claim content carries a reusable law-governed declaration about its exact `EntityOfConcern` and includes all of the following with substantive meaning:

- direct `SubjectKind` and `RangedValueKind` declarations that identify the declared subject and value range;
- `Vocabulary` that supplies the designators needed to reuse the declaration;
- `Laws` that state the reusable predicates, equations, invariants, closure conditions, or other declared regularities;
- `Applicability` that bounds where those claims are used;
- `ResultKind`, `SliceSet`, `ExtentRule`, and dependency, import, or provided-name declarations only when those distinctions are current for the declaration.

Judge the complete claim content, not a selected subset or the presence of field names. A minimal directly authored signature may carry the declaration content required by the A.6.0 membership predicate in one claim graph without citing any smaller episteme. A signature may instead cite separately identified source or dependency epistemes, provided its own claim graph names the dependency relation and the declaration meaning thereby reused. Those source epistemes remain separate individuals connected through their governing dependency, source-use, edition, or other direct relations; they are not components assembled into the signature, and their citation alone does not establish signature membership.

E.24.UK governs the one-time public admission of the dependent kind. In project work, authoring a new declaration candidate, or revising a declaration so that its claim content, exact `EntityOfConcern`, or effective `U.ReferenceScheme` changes, yields a resulting C.2.1 discriminator triple. When the one `EpistemeConstitutionRelation` for that triple obtains, C.2.1 identifies the resulting episteme; A.6.0 then judges whether that already identified individual satisfies the `U.Signature` membership predicate, without adding a second constitution occurrence or identity discriminator. An optional separately reviewable membership judgment is another classification-assertion episteme whose exact `EntityOfConcern` is the candidate. For citation, comparison, reuse, or membership judgment with unchanged C.2.1 discriminators, the candidate episteme and its constitution occurrence remain the same.

The signature keeps the C.2.1 identity of the same episteme. Two designations resolve to that same individual only while the complete claim content, exact `EntityOfConcern`, and effective `U.ReferenceScheme` are unchanged. Changing any discriminator identifies another `U.Episteme`; call that new individual a `U.Signature` only if it independently satisfies the membership predicate above. State an edition, refinement, or supersession relation only when its own direct predicate obtains.

The declared subject remains the independently governed `EntityOfConcern`, not the signature. A realization of the declaration remains under its direct pattern. A description whose `EntityOfConcern` is the signature is another episteme. Publication occurrence, publication form, `U.PresentationCarrier`, and representations remain separate objects and relations under their direct patterns; publication or visible form establishes neither identity nor membership. G.11 currentness and every later work or use likewise remain neighboring judgments and relations rather than signature identity components.

#### A.6.0:4.2 - Write the minimum declaration content

The four content groups are semantic components, not a mandatory visual table. A publication form may present them as paragraphs, a table, formal declarations, or another representation. A publication occurrence makes a selected episteme edition available through that form without changing its content.

| Content group | Content and use |
|---|---|
| `SubjectKind`, `RangedValueKind`, optional `ResultKind`, `SliceSet`, and `ExtentRule` | Name the declared subject and value range, plus a distinct result kind when current. When membership of the same `SubjectKind` can differ across context slices, `SliceSet` names the addressable `U.ContextSlice` values to consider and `ExtentRule` states how membership is judged at one selected slice, thereby determining `Extension(SubjectKind, slice)`. |
| `Vocabulary` | Declares the public designators for value kinds, relation kinds, operators, and other independently identified declared objects. A `RelationSignature` may include SlotSpecs under A.6.5; each SlotSpec gives a declaration-local SlotKind name and the exact participant ValueKind and designation mode. A mechanism may include operation argument and result declarations under A.6.1. E.24.UK governs public U-kind admission. |
| `Laws` | States semantic predicates, equations, invariants, closure conditions, and other declared regularities. Use A.6.1 to state an operation-admission predicate for a mechanism, A.3.1 to identify the Method, A.13 to recover each exact actual performer, and A.15.1 for independent admission of the dated Work that enacts the Method. Add F.6 only when the receiving signature use also consumes precise assignment-bound attribution; a missing or failed F.6 relation leaves the Work intact. Writing the operation-admission predicate as a condition does not make it a signature law. |
| `Applicability` | States the exact `U.ClaimScope` and any other use qualifiers current for this declaration, such as a relevant time interval or selected `CHR:ReferencePlane`. Cite an optional `modelUseStructureRef : U.StructureRef` only when an independently selected model-use structure changes interpretation. |

`SubjectKind` and `RangedValueKind` are declaration-content components. C.3 governs the declared kinds; E.24.UK governs public U-kind admission. A.2.6 supplies addressable `U.ContextSlice` values; C.3.2 governs the membership judgment and any optional materialized `KindExtension` representation. `SliceSet` is not a generic space, time interval, numeric or result range, or changing dataset. `ExtentRule` tells how the declared kind's members are determined at one named slice. A time selector may be part of a `U.ContextSlice`; a value or result range stays in `RangedValueKind` or `ResultKind`; changing data stays with its subject pattern; and a claim-bearing mathematical set representation opens C.29 only for a mathematical-lens use. Leave both fields out unless membership of the same declared kind can differ across the named slices.

Applicability and meaning remain distinct. The effective `U.ReferenceScheme` is part of episteme identity. The exact `U.ClaimScope` delimits use; when current for the declaration, a relevant time interval, selected `CHR:ReferencePlane`, or selected `BoundedModelUseStructure : U.Structure` further delimits or organizes applicability. Retain both the effective `U.ReferenceScheme` and exact `U.ClaimScope` when adding these applicability qualifiers.

#### A.6.0:4.3 - Use RelationSignature for reusable relation declaration

`RelationSignature` is the relation-facing use of one `U.Signature`. It is not a second U-kind.

Its `EntityOfConcernRef` identifies one exact already admitted direct relation kind. If `A.6.RCD` settles a derived relation kind, that kind counts here only after its direct subject settlement states the participant meanings, exact base-definition and named-substrate dependencies, obtaining and applicability laws, and a direct occurrence-identity rule. The derivation or predicate definition may be cited as a dependency, but a predicate-definition episteme whose `EntityOfConcern` is the reusable predicate definition rather than the admitted relation kind is not a `RelationSignature`. A `RelationSignature` declares:

- the relation-kind designator;
- one `SlotSpec` for each world-side participant meaning that needs reusable typed declaration;
- the direct pattern's obtaining predicate and declared laws, restated for reuse without claiming that the predicate is satisfied;
- applicability of those claims;
- the occurrence-identity rule supplied by the direct relation pattern, restated for reuse without applying it to any occurrence;
- for an admitted derived relation kind, the exact base relation definitions, named substrate and authorized derivation operation, and applicability dependencies already established by the direct subject settlement.

The direct relation pattern remains authoritative for when the relation obtains and how an individuated occurrence keeps identity. The signature declares those rules for reuse.

A direct relation may obtain before anyone writes a signature. Ordinary prose may therefore stop at:

> During Shift-17, Robot-7 is assigned as inspector through InspectionAssignment-17.

This is an A.2.1 assertion about an occurrence of declared species `MaintenanceInspectionAssignment` under `U.SystemRoleAssignment`. A.2.1 defines the species' predicate and occurrence-identity rule. The occurrence has `Robot-7` as holder, `InspectorSystemRole` as assigned-kind value, and only the values required for any other declared participants. When several patterns must reuse those participant meanings, predicate, and identity rule, the species' `RelationSignature` becomes useful for typed assertions and F.6 attribution. When another claim must refer to this assignment episode, use A.6.REL for explicit individuation.

#### A.6.0:4.4 - Declare participant meanings and operation parameters under different specializations

For each world-side participant meaning whose reusable declaration is current, a `RelationSignature` declares one A.6.5 SlotSpec. The following code sketch is a compact representation of that declaration:

```text
SlotSpec := <SlotKind, ValueKind, refMode>
refMode := ByValue | RefKind
```

| Component | Meaning in a RelationSignature |
|---|---|
| `SlotKind` | The declaration-local name by which this `RelationSignature` distinguishes one participant meaning of its EntityOfConcern relation kind. It is not a participant, system-role kind, or mathematical operand. |
| `ValueKind` | The exact world-side kind admitted for the relation participant. |
| `refMode` | How a receiving episteme, such as an assertion, description, or occurrence record, carries a participant designation: by value or through one exact governed RefKind. That designation denotes the actual participant. The occurrence record and the relation occurrence are distinct. |

Use A.6.5 to declare these participant meanings. In the simple `MaintenanceInspectionAssignment` species, use `HolderSystemSlot` and one declaration-local `AssignedSystemRoleKindSlot` with `MaintenanceSystemRoleKindDomain` as its ValueKind and `ByValue` as its refMode. In `InspectionAssignment-17`, `InspectorSystemRole` is the assigned-kind participant value. A stronger species adds only a real participant that changes its predicate or occurrence identity. Taxonomy episteme, reference scheme, interval description, and generic context may interpret an assertion but are not generic world-side assignment participants. Do not force SlotSpecs into a one-off assertion that has no receiving typed use.

A formal or mechanism declaration may instead need named operation arguments and a result. A.6.1 governs that `OperationAlgebra`. A representation may use a mathematical operand order, product, function, or tuple. A.6.3.RT governs a same-EntityOfConcern representation-scheme transition; C.29 governs only a mathematical-lens use. Those operation parameters do not become `RelationSignature` SlotSpecs or SlotKinds merely because the same notation uses angle brackets or numbered arguments. When a relation claim consumes a mathematical representation, state an explicit correspondence between the representation's operands and the independently declared SlotSpecs.

#### A.6.0:4.5 - Expose real declaration dependencies

Open a `SignatureManifest` only after this test. Add an import when removing one named provider would leave this declaration unable to interpret a required non-local term or unable to replay one of its stated laws; name the provider and the exact required term or law. Add a provide entry when this declaration introduces a named term or law and one named dependent declaration relies on it. A background citation, similar vocabulary, shared publication, list membership, or convenient replay order is not a dependency.

The `SignatureManifest` heading co-locates entries with three functions: `id` is an identity-neutral display designator; `signatureRef` and its optional `.edition` pin form a governed reference to an already recoverable signature episteme; and `imports` and `provides` may carry or represent dependency and name-or-law introduction claims in the signature's exact `U.ClaimGraph`.

The `SignatureManifest` section may carry entries with these functions:

| Entry | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `id : SignatureId` | An identity-neutral display designator or representation metadata for one already independently identified signature episteme. It is not a governed reference and does not enter the C.2.1 identity triple. |
| `signatureRef : U.EpistemeRef` | A governed reference resolving to the already identified signature episteme selected for replay. Changing its serialization preserves the referent only while resolution returns that same episteme under the effective reference scheme. |
| `signatureRef.edition` | An optional edition pin on `signatureRef` for one already recoverable episteme edition. The pin neither enters the C.2.1 identity triple nor establishes that an `EpistemeEditionRelation` obtains. |
| `imports` | When the signature's exact `U.ClaimGraph` states that interpretation requires a named term or that replay requires an exact law claim from a named provider declaration, this entry carries that claim content or visibly represents it. Name both provider and required term or law. The designators, governed references, or list membership alone establish no dependency or source-use occurrence. |
| `provides` | When the signature's exact `U.ClaimGraph` states that it introduces a public term or law on which a named dependent declaration relies, this entry carries that claim content or visibly represents it. Public SlotKinds and RefKinds can be named terms. Being listed establishes no consumer dependency by itself. |

A change confined to the spelling of `id` or the serialization of `signatureRef` preserves episteme identity only when the reference still resolves to the same episteme and its exact claim content, exact EntityOfConcern, and effective `U.ReferenceScheme` remain unchanged. Changing `signatureRef.edition` selects another already recoverable edition; it does not by itself establish an edition relation, historical continuity, or `U.Signature` membership for the referent. If a C.2.1 identity discriminator changes, A.6.0:4.10 governs the resulting identity.

Use these dependency-manifest predicates:

- **SM-1 Term-and-law resolution.** Every required non-local term or exact law claim resolves under the effective reference scheme to the one named provider declaration that supplies it.
- **SM-2 No redeclaration and legal direction.** A provided term or law is not also supplied by a transitive import under the same effective reference scheme, and the claimed provider-to-consumer direction matches the predicate of the exact dependency or source-use relation rather than a drawn arrow or list order.
- **SM-3 Replay order and cycles.** A selected one-pass provider-to-consumer replay method requires an acyclic ordering of the recovered dependency designations. A cycle means that this replay method cannot run; it does not by itself prove that every semantic dependency in the cycle is prohibited. Apply each exact dependency governor to its edge. If no current governor decides whether the semantic cycle is legal, return an exact missing-governor blocker instead of deleting an edge or inventing an order. Keep the graph representation, cycle check, and ordering notation separate from the semantic dependency claims; use C.29 only when a mathematical-lens use is current.
- **SM-4 Export boundary.** A dependent declaration relies on provided names and cited laws, not on private publication layout or implementation detail.

The remove-the-provider test above identifies a candidate dependency. State the exact dependency or source-use relation only after its direct predicate is satisfied for the named provider, consumer, term or law, and use. A citation, manifest entry, list membership, or replay result can support an assertion about that relation. A provider or provider-edition change may require resolution, replay, or currentness review; it changes the consumer signature's identity only when the consumer's own claim content, exact EntityOfConcern, or effective reference scheme changes.

A governed reference to a separately identified object is not an exported vocabulary name merely because that reference appears in the signature.

#### A.6.0:4.6 - Specialize declaration use without minting another root kind

A signature profile is a constrained use of the same `U.Signature` kind. The profile states which content is current and which neighboring patterns define or constrain later use.

**`profile = FormalSubstrate`.** Declare vocabulary and terms, inference kinds, formal laws, applicability, and the actual declaration dependencies carried in the signature's claim content. A.6.1 separately governs `OperationAlgebra`, operation designators, typed argument and result positions, admission conditions, application, and realization. An A.6.1 declaration may cite the FormalSubstrate signature. When a mathematical object is selected as a lens for another entity, C.29 governs the lens-use claim.

**`profile = PrincipleFrame`.** Write the postulates and invariants, then name the observable distinction each one requires: what must be observed or compared to tell whether the frame's claim holds. Cite the separately identified characteristic or measurement declaration that makes that distinction checkable; units, scales, `CHR:ReferencePlane` values, comparators, and normalizations remain under A.17, A.18, C.16, CHR, A.19.CPM, and A.19.UNM. If the text decides whether a proposed operation application, run, or gate may proceed, move that decision to A.6.1 or the direct evaluation and gate pattern, including A.21/C.11 where applicable. A PrincipleFrame may state what a decision must respect, but it is not that admission decision. For ordinary reuse, apply the frame's Applicability and the direct subject rules for any reference-plane or model-use-structure question. When the receiving claim needs an exact semantic relation between two local senses whose interpretation bases differ, first recover the two exact F.17 local senses; cite an F.9 Bridge only if its direct predicate obtains and state the bounded-use claim, direction, preservation, loss, and any required reliance separately. Cited declarations remain independently identified objects, not extra PrincipleFrame identity components.

State a relation between two signatures directly as refinement, conservative extension, equivalence, or another independently governed relation only when that relation's own predicate obtains. Before using the refinement label, compare all three reusable content duties: `Vocabulary`, `Laws`, and `Applicability`. Name the terms preserved, added, or removed; the laws preserved, strengthened, or changed; and whether the population, time, `CHR:ReferencePlane`, and claim scope stay the same, narrow, or widen. An unexplained applicability widening fails the refinement claim; use another direct relation whose predicate explicitly permits the widening instead of hiding it under `refinement`. Use a C.29 morphism only when a mathematical structure-preservation claim is actually current.

#### A.6.0:4.6a - Rule-content actual-use predicate declaration

`RuleContentBasisFindingDefinition@R7` is one ordinary `U.Signature` for two reusable predicates over claim content. Its exact EntityOfConcern is the reusable predicate definition; both `SubjectKind` and `RangedValueKind` are `U.ClaimGraph`. No distinct result kind is current because an ordinary C.2.1 assertion states whether a predicate obtains. The declaration is not a `RelationSignature`: `dependentContent` and `baseContent` are semantic parameters, not world-side relation participants or A.6.5 SlotSpecs.

Its vocabulary includes `SelectedRuleContentSubgraphDesignation@RuleContentBasisFindingDefinition-R7`, `derivedUsingRuleContent@RuleContentBasisFindingDefinition-R7`, and `evaluatedAgainstRuleContent@RuleContentBasisFindingDefinition-R7`. The designation resolves one exact nonempty base subgraph selected for one identified use. `RuleContentDerivationProfile@R7`, `RuleContentEvaluationProfile@R7`, and `RuleContentBasisFamilyAlgebra@R7` are named subgraphs of this signature's ClaimGraph.

The derivation predicate obtains only when an identified derivation claim used exact `baseContent` as a formal premise under a declared inference rule or application to produce exact `dependentContent`. The evaluation predicate obtains only when an identified criterion-selection claim selected exact `baseContent` for one exact bounded evaluation claim concerning `dependentContent`. Definition, constraint, applicability, consultation, citation, influence, provenance, evidence, evaluation Work, result, sufficiency, assurance, reliance, authority, and publication establish neither predicate by themselves.

An assertion names the exact actual-use claim identity and bounded receiving use, and adds scope, temporal policy, scheme interpretation, Bridge/loss, or source/witness qualifications only when each independently changes that assertion. A changed subject, content, mode, use, actual-use claim, scope extension, time policy, or interpreted endpoint identifies a successor assertion under C.2.1 rather than mutating every use of this reusable definition.

R7 is a changed-law successor of historical `RuleContentBasisFindingDefinition@R6`, not identity-continuous reuse. The C.2.1 succession assertion names predecessor, successor, `changeClass = reusable-law-change`, the changed law set—formal-premise/criterion-selection truth split, owner-claim removal, per-question analysis separation, independent candidate axes, pairwise compatibility, temporal-policy identity, and non-permissive reliance—and `inheritedAcceptanceOrUse = none`. A dependency pin selects R6 or R7 explicitly; a pin change reopens dependants rather than silently retargeting them.

#### A.6.0:4.7 - Keep declaration, realization, and use under their direct patterns

| Current object or claim | Subject pattern |
|---|---|
| Constitution and C.2.1 identity of the exact claim-bearing episteme, including a separately identified relation-occurrence description episteme | C.2.1; the direct object or relation pattern still governs the described EntityOfConcern |
| Reusable declaration episteme and `U.Signature` membership | A.6.0 |
| Relation obtaining and explicitly individuated occurrence | Direct relation pattern and A.6.REL |
| `RelationSignature` SlotSpecs and participant-designation discipline | A.6.5 |
| Mechanism `OperationAlgebra`, typed argument and result positions, admission conditions, application, and realization | A.6.1 |
| Method | A.3.1 |
| Performed work | A.15.1 |
| Optional source-to-receiving-episteme viewing construction | A.6.3 |
| Same-EntityOfConcern representation-scheme transition | A.6.3.RT |
| Cross-reference-scheme, cross-plane, or changed model-use-structure use | Use F.9 only when the use relates two exact F.17 local senses and its direct Bridge predicate obtains; state the bounded-use claim separately. Otherwise use the direct plane or model-use-structure pattern. |
| Numeric comparison, normalization, units, scales, and measurement | A.19.CPM and A.19.UNM, together with A.17, A.18, C.16, and the direct measurement pattern when each object or relation is current |
| Mathematical or diagrammatic lens use, including its operand mapping or correspondence | C.29 |
| Current representation-factor bundle for governed episteme publication positions | C.2.7 |
| Publication-face use and the distinct publication occurrence, form, and carrier relations | E.17 for the publication-face use profile; E.24.PUB for the direct occurrence, form, and carrier relations |
| Evidence-use or status-use relation | A.2.4 |
| Evidence-provenance graph or path | A.10 |
| Actual named assurance claim and its bounded result | B.3 |
| Operational gate profile and the decision that uses its result | A.21 and C.11 |

The rows name the direct patterns that define or constrain these common adjacent objects and claims.

#### A.6.0:4.8 - Add explicit objects only for a named receiving use

Make three decisions by naming the next sentence, comparison, tool, or declaration that must work:

1. **State the direct relation and stop.** Use this branch when the task only asks whether one direct relation's predicate holds for its actual participants under its subject pattern's conditions. State the affirmative or negative claim under that pattern, or an exact governed modal claim when that family is current. For example, `During Shift-17, Robot-7 is assigned as inspector through InspectionAssignment-17` is a complete current A.2.1 assertion when the direct `MaintenanceInspectionAssignment` predicate holds. Add an A.10 or receiving-evaluation reliance judgment only when the task separately asks whether to rely on the assertion.
2. **Share one declaration.** Reuse or author a signature when at least two named claims or consumers must use the same participant meanings, vocabulary, laws, or applicability. For example, a staffing assertion and an F.6 Work-attribution consumer can cite the `MaintenanceInspectionAssignment` `RelationSignature` when both must interpret `HolderSystemSlot`, its declaration-local `AssignedSystemRoleKindSlot` with `MaintenanceSystemRoleKindDomain` as ValueKind and `ByValue` as refMode, any real species-specific participants, and the same direct predicate. In `InspectionAssignment-17`, `InspectorSystemRole` is the assigned-kind participant value. One sentence that merely repeats the word `assigned` does not open this branch. When a declaration is authored, C.2.1 identifies the episteme from its own claim content, exact EntityOfConcern, and effective reference scheme; A.6.0 then judges `U.Signature` membership.
3. **Distinguish one occurrence.** Open occurrence identity only when a later claim must refer to that same occurrence, compare or qualify it, track its beginning, continuation, cessation, or change, or use it as a participant of another relation. For example, F.6 work attribution must cite the exact covering assignment episode, and a staffing history that compares Shift-17 with a later reassignment must apply A.2.1's uninterrupted-obtaining same-versus-new-occurrence rule. A roster-row identifier that merely designates an assertion identifies neither the assignment occurrence nor a new occurrence; use F.18 only after A.2.1 has distinguished the occurrence to which a reference should resolve.

These are the `receiving-use` thresholds. They concern three different objects and are not stages that construct a relation or episteme from need. The stop is observable: the target direct assertion, shared declaration for the named consumers, or occurrence-referencing claim can be written without another unresolved object. That target motivates authoring, selection, reuse, or explicit individuation. Apply C.2.1 to episteme identity and the direct relation pattern to occurrence identity. Selecting or reusing an unchanged episteme leaves its identity unchanged. When entries, branches, returns, or stops form one reusable structure, apply A.22.CGUS only after the A.22 identity, local locus bindings, selected relations and constraints, and potential continuations are recoverable.

#### A.6.0:4.9 - Recover formal-substrate and PrincipleFrame uses by direct governing relation

| Current claim | Direct governed use |
|---|---|
| Author, select, or cite a formal declaration | Use `U.Signature(profile=FormalSubstrate)` with its subject, vocabulary, inference kinds, laws, applicability, and real dependencies. |
| Use a mathematical object to preserve selected structure while hiding other structure | Use C.29 and state the mathematical-lens relation. |
| Declare, apply, or realize an operation | Use A.6.1 for the `OperationAlgebra`, typed argument and result positions, admission conditions, application, and realization; cite a FormalSubstrate signature only when that named dependency is current. |
| Carry an encountered distinction toward later work | Use E.18.1 for the carry-through relation. |

The same independently identified formal object or episteme can participate in these different uses while retaining its own identity and kind. State the applicable declaration, dependency, operation, lens, or carry-through relation for the receiving use.

For a `PrincipleFrame`, write one postulate or invariant together with the observable difference that would count for or against it. Cite a characteristic, measurement, unit, scale, reference plane, comparator, or normalization declaration only when that declaration is needed to state or check that difference; an informative citation is not a dependency. Do not put an operation-admission, run-acceptance, or gate-passage verdict into the frame. For ordinary reuse, apply the frame's Applicability and the direct subject rules for any reference-plane or model-use-structure question. If the receiving claim needs an exact semantic relation between two local senses whose interpretation bases differ, recover the two exact F.17 local senses and test the direct F.9 predicate; cite a Bridge only when it obtains, state preservation and loss in a separate bounded-use claim, and establish any required reliance before use. A cited declaration may be superseded, or an independently obtaining dependency relation may cease or be replaced, without retroactively changing the PrincipleFrame's identity. Changing the PrincipleFrame's own citation or dependency claim changes its claim content and therefore identifies another episteme; the same follows when its exact EntityOfConcern or effective reference scheme changes. Any edition, refinement, or supersession relation between the two epistemes must independently obtain and must pass the Vocabulary-Laws-Applicability comparison above.

#### A.6.0:4.10 - Change the exact object that changed

Apply C.2.1 first. Every `U.Episteme` is identified by exact claim content carried by one exact `U.ClaimGraph`, one exact EntityOfConcern, and one effective `U.ReferenceScheme`. Changing any member of this mandatory triple identifies another episteme. That episteme is a `U.Signature` only when it independently satisfies A.6.0 membership. A changed discriminator, `SignatureId`, or `signatureRef.edition` value does not by itself establish signature membership or historical continuity.

A change to `imports` or `provides` changes the consumer signature's identity only when it changes that signature's own claim content. A changed provider or provider edition can instead leave the consumer episteme unchanged while requiring the named dependency or source-use assertion, resolution result, replay result, or currentness judgment to be reconsidered.

A changed later use does not change the signature unless the change alters one of its C.2.1 identity discriminators. For example, a new mechanism realization remains a new realization, and a new publication layout remains a new publication form.

Connect two different epistemes by `EpistemeEditionRelation`, refinement, supersession, or another independently governed continuity relation only when that relation's own predicate obtains under its direct governor. Revision work, shared title, changed identifier, citation, or sequence alone establishes no such occurrence.

When a once-current signature becomes stale while its identity remains recoverable, G.11 governs currentness and selection among recoverable editions.

Reopen declaration authoring when a proposed change affects the signature's exact claim content, EntityOfConcern, effective reference scheme, declared dependency, Vocabulary, Laws, Applicability, or the boundary of a FormalSubstrate, PrincipleFrame, or other admitted profile. The revised claim-bearing candidate is another C.2.1 episteme; A.6.0 judges its signature membership again, and any edition, refinement, or supersession relation remains a separate claim under its direct governor. Also reopen the affected declaration element when current problem-owning-domain or formal-method SoTA changes the term, inference form, law shape, applicability condition, or realization boundary being declared.

When a governed kind name, `SubjectKind`, `RangedValueKind`, SlotKind, RefKind, or exported term is renamed, apply F.19 to the changed wording; use E.10 for unresolved lexical questions and F.18 for durable naming. Accept the rename only when a cold reader can still recover the same FPF kind, declaration use, and practical action; otherwise keep the old name or return the naming defect. Do not revise the signature merely because a realization, work occurrence, measurement, Bridge use, evidence-use relation, publication, provider currentness, or G.11 selection changed. Update that neighboring object under its subject pattern, and reopen the signature only if its own claim or dependency content must change.

### A.6.0:5 - Archetypal Grounding

#### A.6.0:5.1 - Physical modeling: connector-equation FormalSubstrate

A multi-domain modeling team repeatedly uses one connector-and-equation calculus. The `EntityOfConcernRef` of its `U.Signature(profile=FormalSubstrate)` identifies that calculus. `SubjectKind` names the modeled connector declarations governed by the calculus, and `RangedValueKind` names its well-formed terms and equations. Vocabulary names the potential and flow variables. Its inference and equation laws say how a selected connection assertion yields potential equality and the zero-sum flow equation. Applicability states the modeling assumptions and selected `CHR:ReferencePlane`. If those terms or laws cannot be interpreted or replayed without a named quantity declaration, the manifest names that provider and the exact imported term or law; otherwise a background citation stays outside the dependency manifest.

The sentence `ModeledPort_A is connected to ModeledPort_B` is a separate model-side connection assertion. If repeated typed connection claims require a `RelationSignature`, first recover or admit the exact modeled-connection relation kind, its two connectable-port participant meanings, direct predicate, qualifier laws, Applicability, and occurrence-identity rule; only then may that relation declaration cite this FormalSubstrate when the dependency test passes. A generated equation set and a connector diagram are later result and representation epistemes, not either declaration; use A.6.1 for operations, A.15.1 for Work, and E.24.PUB for publication. Govern each representation and its declared correspondence through the applicable representation pattern, including A.6.3.RT for a same-EntityOfConcern representation-scheme transition. Open C.29 only for a mathematical-lens use.

Practical payoff: engineers can compare the connector vocabulary and equation laws across tools.

#### A.6.0:5.2 - Clinical work: dose-response claim before relation-kind admission

A clinician needs the ordinary claim: `During PatientEpisode_8472, Intervention_5mg was associated with OutcomeChange_BPminus10 over ObservationWindow_Days0to28 under the stated dosing and population conditions.` No current direct pattern in this corpus governs a `DoseResponseRelationKind`. For this use, A.6.RCD therefore keeps the sentence as a local compound claim in one C.2.1 episteme; repeated clinical uses may justify a reusable predicate-definition episteme, but neither result is a `RelationSignature` or a relation occurrence.

The local predicate treats the named patient episode, intervention, outcome change, and observation window as its exact inputs. `ObservationWindow_Days0to28` answers how long this patient's outcome change is aggregated for this assertion. The claim's or reusable definition's Applicability instead states the population, dosing protocol and conditions, and the time and claim scope in which the rule is used. Do not repeat the patient window as Applicability unless a separate applicability claim genuinely uses that same interval. Before any `RelationSignature` can be published, the missing-governor result must name the candidate relation kind, these participant meanings, the direct predicate, Applicability, occurrence-identity rule, and a standalone clinical domain governor; E.24/E.24.UK must admit the result.

A selected assay-result episteme may support or refute the compound assertion. Use A.2.4/A.10 to qualify that evidence use and any intended reliance. When an assay result changes, reassess whether it supports or refutes the same bounded assertion; that assessment may stay the same, change, or be unresolved. The reusable predicate definition remains unchanged. A changed outcome meaning, population, dosing condition, or declared applicability changes the definition's claim content and C.2.1 identity.

Practical payoff: clinicians and analysts can write and compare the bounded claim now, reuse a settled predicate definition when repetition warrants it, and keep patient episodes, evidence epistemes, and evidence-use claims distinct.

#### A.6.0:5.3 - Learning: criterion declaration and evidence use

During `AssessmentInterval_2026Q2`, learner `Learner_17` correctly diagnoses cavitation in `PumpCase_A` and `PumpCase_B` and selects the stated corrective action. A separate observation episteme, `PerformanceObservation_17A`, states what was observed. After applying the reusable declaration `Criterion_PumpCavitationDiagnosis_v3`, assessor `Assessor_4` makes the separate competence-assertion episteme `CompetenceAssertion_17_Q2`: `Learner_17 met Criterion_PumpCavitationDiagnosis_v3 for diagnosing cavitation and selecting the stated corrective action in PumpCase_A and PumpCase_B during AssessmentInterval_2026Q2.`

`Criterion_PumpCavitationDiagnosis_v3` is the reusable declaration governed here. Its `EntityOfConcernRef` identifies the pump-cavitation diagnosis criterion; `SubjectKind` names assessed pump-cavitation diagnostic performances and `RangedValueKind` names the results `meets` and `does not meet`. Vocabulary defines the cases, diagnosis, and corrective action; Laws say which observable response earns either result; Applicability limits the equipment family, task form, and assessment method. No current direct pattern supplies `DemonstratedCompetenceRelationKind`, so this case asserts neither that relation signature nor a world-side demonstrated-competence occurrence.

For this bounded assessment use, the direct A.2.4/A.10 evidence-use relation names `PerformanceObservation_17A` as `EvidenceEpisteme`, the quoted competence claim as `EvidenceTargetClaim`, the two specified cases as `EvidenceClaimScope`, `supports` as `EvidencePolarity`, and `AssessmentInterval_2026Q2` as `EvidenceRelevanceWindow`. Its A.10 evidence-provenance path identifies the observation work, method, carrier, and assessor's relying context. That relation supports reliance on this exact competence claim; it does not authorize course progression. A self-report without that observation path, a performance on another task, or a performance outside the named interval does not support this bounded claim.

Changing the publication form or making another publication occurrence for the unchanged criterion or competence assertion changes neither episteme. Changing the criterion's Vocabulary, Laws, or Applicability changes its claim content and identifies another declaration episteme; any edition or continuity relation must separately obtain. A new performance observation or assessor claim likewise identifies separate evidence or claim content rather than changing the criterion declaration.

Practical payoff: two assessors or curriculum tools can reuse the same declared criterion and its performance-and-result meanings while making separately identified competence claims about separately observed performances.

#### A.6.0:5.4 - Formal work: length-indexed zero-vector operation

An engineer declares the reusable operation `zeroVector(n)` in ordinary language: give it a natural number `n`; it returns a vector of `n` real-valued entries, every one zero. In the A.6.1 `OperationDeclaration`, argument `lengthIndex` means the requested component count and has ValueKind `NaturalNumber`. Result `zeroVectorResult` means the returned zero vector and has the indexed result family `FiniteVector(RealScalar, n)`. The application predicate says that one application binds one `n` and returns that vector. The dependency law states `length(zeroVector(n)) = n`, and the zero law states that every indexed entry equals scalar zero. Applicability limits this declaration to finite vectors over the declared `RealScalar` field.

The declaration imports the exact type-former `FiniteVector(RealScalar, n)` and its length-index law from FormalSubstrate signature `FiniteVectorSubstrate_v2`. Remove that provider and neither the result declaration can be interpreted nor the length law replayed, so this is a declaration dependency rather than a background citation. The operation argument and result remain A.6.1 declarations; they are not A.6.5 relation SlotSpecs.

A Lean representation may write the result as `Vector Real n`. A proof-carrying record representation may write `entries: List Real` together with `lengthProof: entries.length = n`. Because both represent the same operation declaration and no mathematical lens changes the next comparison action, A.6.3.RT alone governs this representation-scheme transition. It preserves the result-length index and the all-zero law. Lean binder order, implicit elaboration, record field order, and the location of the length proof are representation-local and need not survive. Stop here: no C.29 result is needed. If a later comparison uses a named free-module lens to decide algebraic reuse, that changed lens use opens C.29 and must separately state the preserved addition and scalar action and the lost coordinate or layout detail. State a blocked inference only when it passes F.19:4's full guard test.

Practical payoff: formal-methods engineers can fill and inspect the dependent A.6.1 declaration, test its actual FormalSubstrate dependency, and compare representations.

#### A.6.0:5.5 - PrincipleFrame: heat-flow balance

A thermal-modeling team writes a `PrincipleFrame` stating that net heat flow across a selected system boundary must balance the change in stored energy. The frame names the observable distinction between inward and outward heat flow at that boundary. It cites separately governed heat-flow characteristics, units, the selected `CHR:ReferencePlane`, and the measurement declaration needed to check that distinction; its Applicability names the modeled systems and conditions for which the balance claim is made.

A comparison result may show that the residual is below the chosen tolerance. The comparator and tolerance remain under their direct comparison and measurement patterns; operation admission remains under A.6.1, and a gate-passage verdict remains under A.21/C.11. If a laboratory measurement sense is proposed for use in a plant-model sense, resolve both exact F.17 local senses and apply F.9. Cite a Bridge only when its predicate obtains; state the bounded use and any preservation or loss of sign convention, unit, and boundary interpretation separately.

Practical payoff: the physical principle remains reusable while the measurement setup, comparator, run decision, and cross-scheme transport can change or fail independently.

#### A.6.0:5.6 - Reduced ordinary-use case

The sentence `During Shift-17, Robot-7 is assigned as inspector through InspectionAssignment-17` is enough for a task that only reports whether the direct `MaintenanceInspectionAssignment` predicate holds for its actual participants during that episode. Stop there. If a staffing assertion and an F.6 Work-attribution consumer must reuse the same participant meanings and assignment laws, cite that direct species' existing `RelationSignature`. If later Work attribution or history must distinguish this assignment from a later reassignment, apply A.2.1's direct occurrence-identity rule and refer to the distinguished episode. A roster-row id that merely points to the assertion opens neither branch. Each result is complete for its stated task; the shorter result is not an incomplete signature.

### A.6.0:6 - Bias-Annotation

**Scope declaration:** Universal across FPF-governed domains.

- **Gov.** Favors making the direct governor of declaration membership, declared content, and neighboring claims inspectable, together with explicit dependencies. Counter-risk: declaration administration can grow beyond reuse value. Mitigation: add `SignatureManifest` only for actual dependency.
- **Arch.** Favors a small declaration core with direct neighboring patterns. Counter-risk: the signature becomes a central container. Mitigation: keep realization, work, evaluation, and publication with their direct patterns.
- **Onto-Epist.** Favors strict separation of declaration episteme, declared subject, obtaining occurrence, assertion, and representation. Counter-risk: excessive explicitness. Mitigation: stop at the direct assertion unless two named consumers share declaration content or one later claim must distinguish the occurrence.
- **Prag.** Favors reusable named SlotSpecs and laws. Counter-risk: one-off work becomes formal paperwork. Mitigation: ordinary direct sentences remain sufficient.
- **Did.** Favors the four content groups and local mantra. Counter-risk: readers treat the mnemonic order as a required execution order. Mitigation: apply A.22.CGUS only to an independently identified structure of potential continuations; actual execution remains a separate Work or Transformation claim.
- **Context transport.** Interpret the signature's claims under the effective `U.ReferenceScheme` and use them within their stated scope. Counter-risk: the same label in another context is treated as equivalent or safely substitutable. Mitigation: when a proposed reuse relates two exact F.17 local senses, test the direct F.9 predicate and cite a Bridge only when it obtains; state direction, rule, tolerated loss, and polarity in a separate bounded-use claim. Without the needed semantic relation and use claim, do not transport the claim by label alone.
- **Comparability.** Two declarations do not become comparable because both expose numbers. Counter-risk: numeric appearance hides incompatible characteristics, measurement procedures, units, scales, comparators, or normalization. Mitigation: apply the current A.17/A.18/C.16 characteristic, measurement, and unit-and-scale patterns and A.19.CPM/A.19.UNM comparison and normalization patterns as the case requires, then state the resulting comparison boundary; keep their detailed legality and result-shape rules with those subject patterns.
- **Register.** Make technical declaration blocks and worked cases readable for their intended use. Counter-risk: a technically correct block remains unusable without private decoding. Mitigation: apply F.19's connected reading and local revalidation. Unpack decisive FPF terms or add an ordinary explanation only when needed to recover the claim or action and its relevant result; preserve the governed object, subject pattern, admissible use, and practical action.

The examples deliberately span physical modeling, medicine, learning, and formal work. Each worked declaration has its own C.2.1 identity, which remains independent of its publication form.

### A.6.0:7 - Conformance Checklist

1. **Exact declaration object.** The text identifies one `U.Signature` episteme and one exact `EntityOfConcernRef`.
2. **Identity.** Content, EntityOfConcern, and effective `U.ReferenceScheme` remain recoverable.
3. **Minimum content.** `SubjectKind` and `RangedValueKind`, together with Vocabulary, Laws, and Applicability, carry semantic content rather than empty publication rows. `ResultKind`, `SliceSet`, and `ExtentRule` appear only when their declared distinctions are current.
4. **Optional slice-dependent membership.** `SliceSet` names the addressable `U.ContextSlice` values to inspect and `ExtentRule` determines `Extension(SubjectKind, slice)` only when the same declared kind can have different members across those slices; neither field stands for a generic interval, range, changing dataset, or set representation.
5. **Vocabulary boundary.** A declared token is not treated as durable U-kind admission without E.24.UK and its direct pattern.
6. **Relation declaration.** A `RelationSignature` identifies one exact already admitted direct relation kind. An admitted derived relation kind has direct subject settlement for participant meanings, base-definition and named-substrate dependencies, obtaining, applicability, and occurrence identity. A predicate-definition episteme is not treated as that `RelationSignature`, and the declaration does not assert an occurrence. Every worked case that uses a `RelationSignature` also names the already admitted relation kind, direct governor and predicate, participant meanings, Applicability, occurrence-identity rule, and one ordinary affirmative or negative assertion. A hypothetical domain-local relation kind is labelled and fully settled before the example uses it.
7. **Direct relation-pattern governance.** The direct relation pattern defines or constrains obtaining and occurrence identity.
8. **Typed-declaration boundary.** Reused participant meanings are declared inside a `RelationSignature` by A.6.5 SlotSpecs with exact SlotKind, ValueKind, and refMode. Operation arguments and results remain A.6.1 declaration content. Mathematical operands and field order remain representation-side under A.6.3.RT; C.29 opens only when a named mathematical lens changes the declared lens use or next comparison action. An operand-to-participant correspondence is stated only for an already governed relation claim.
9. **Semantic locality.** Meaning uses the effective reference scheme; applicability uses the exact claim scope and only qualifiers current for the declaration, such as a relevant time interval, selected `CHR:ReferencePlane`, or genuinely current model-use structure.
10. **Dependency truth.** Every import names the provider and exact term or law without which interpretation or law replay fails; every provide entry names a dependent declaration that relies on the introduced term or law. Citations and list order do not qualify. SM-1 through SM-4 hold, and a replay cycle is distinguished from a semantic-prohibition verdict.
11. **Realization boundary.** Mechanism behavior and admission conditions remain with A.6.1.
12. **Progressive elaboration.** A direct assertion is enough when the task only asks whether the predicate holds; a signature opens when at least two named consumers share declaration content; occurrence identity opens only for a later same-occurrence reference, comparison, qualification, history/change claim, or relation participation. A log or assertion identifier alone opens none of them.
13. **CGUS boundary.** Judge any condition-governed unfolding claim through A.22.CGUS, using the independently identified structure and continuation conditions stated in §4.
14. **Profile boundary.** FormalSubstrate and PrincipleFrame remain profiles of `U.Signature` rather than new root kinds. A PrincipleFrame names its postulates and the observable distinctions needed to check them, leaves operation and gate admission with their subject patterns, and uses F.9 for a relation between two exact F.17 local senses, citing a Bridge only when its direct predicate obtains.
15. **Changed object.** Changed exact claim content carried by the `U.ClaimGraph`, exact EntityOfConcern, or effective reference scheme identifies another episteme. Judge A.6.0 membership for that episteme independently, and assert edition, refinement, supersession, or another continuity relation only when its own predicate obtains. A changed use, identifier, publication form, carrier, provider currentness, or G.11 refresh state does none of those things by itself.
16. **F.19 self-application and reader use.** Apply F.19 by value to every materially changed technical declaration, mantra, checklist instruction, and worked case; revalidate the changed span with its meaning-dependent neighbours. The cold intended reader must be able to recover the same governed object, subject pattern, admissible use, and practical claim or action, including any result that changes that use. Keep ordinary technical wording when it already carries the needed distinctions; unpack terms or add an explanation only when recovery needs it. Use E.10:11 item 16 when the value-substitution question is selected. State a nearby non-use or contrasting case only when F.19:4's full guard test warrants it. A `Plain` label without that reader-visible recovery does not pass.
17. **Case-level witness.** Each worked case names its exact EntityOfConcern, the direct pattern that defines or constrains the claim being made, and what the practitioner can now write, decide, or inspect. State the nearest category error it rejects only when F.19:4's full guard test warrants that contrast. A domain label or the presence of several case headings is not evidence of cross-domain fit.

### A.6.0:8 - Common Anti-Patterns and How to Avoid Them

| Failure mode | Why it fails | Repair |
|---|---|---|
| Signature as publication template | Visual rows and publication metadata become signature identity. | Recover the declaration content and C.2.1 identity; govern publication separately. |
| Relation signature as relation occurrence | Declaring participant meanings and laws is treated as evidence that the relation obtains. | Evaluate the direct predicate for the actual participants, state affirmative or negative assertion polarity under the exact direct claim family, keep supported, refuted, or unresolved reliance with `A.10` or the receiving evaluation, and use A.6.REL only when a receiving use needs occurrence identity. |
| Applicability as context label | One undefined context word hides reference scheme, claim scope, time, selected `CHR:ReferencePlane`, and model use. | Recover each current qualifier under its direct kind or relation. |
| Citation as declaration dependency | A bibliography entry, shared term, or manifest row is treated as proof that one declaration depends on another. | Remove the candidate provider: if the consumer can still interpret every required term and replay every stated law, keep a citation rather than an import. Otherwise name the provider, exact term or law, direct dependency predicate, and named dependent use. |
| Mandatory maximum form | Every sentence receives SlotSpecs, dependencies, editions, and occurrence records. | Name the receiving use and include only the declaration or occurrence-identity objects it needs. |
| Mnemonic as executable sequence | Imperative wording is treated as a runnable continuation structure. | Keep it as Plain recall or declare the actual condition-governed structure with A.22.CGUS. |
| PrincipleFrame as admission verdict | A postulate, invariant, measurement threshold, or comparator result is treated as permission for an operation, run, or gate to proceed. | Keep the postulate and observable distinction in the PrincipleFrame; cite the direct measurement or comparison declaration; use A.6.1 for operation admission and gate passage to A.21/C.11. |
| Realization inside the declaration | Current mechanism behavior or test outcomes become signature laws. | Keep declared laws here; state the mechanism declaration or realization under A.6.1 and the evaluation claim under its direct evaluation pattern. |

### A.6.0:9 - Consequences

**Benefits.**

- Reusable declarations receive one stable episteme identity.
- `RelationSignature` epistemes can expose named typed SlotSpecs without forcing every relation occurrence into a record.
- Meaning becomes inspectable through the exact reference scheme; applicability becomes inspectable through the exact claim scope plus any current time interval, selected `CHR:ReferencePlane`, or selected model-use structure.
- In physical-modeling practice, an author can reuse one connector-equation FormalSubstrate while keeping a modeled connection assertion, generated equations, and a diagram separate from that declaration.
- In clinical practice, an author can write the bounded patient-episode, intervention, and outcome assertion now, relate an assay-result episteme to that claim through A.2.4/A.10, and defer a `RelationSignature` until a direct clinical relation governor exists.
- A changed realization, observation, evidence-use relation, or publication can be repaired independently when the declaration's own claim content, EntityOfConcern, and effective reference scheme remain unchanged.

**Costs and trade-offs.**

- Before choosing a form, the author answers three concrete questions: does the task only ask whether one predicate holds; do at least two named consumers need the same declaration content; or does a later claim need to refer to the same occurrence, compare it with another, qualify it, record its history, or use it as a participant in another relation? Those answers select a direct assertion, reusable declaration, or occurrence identity.
- Authors must recover the exact declared subject and effective reference scheme; a familiar label is not enough.
- A `RelationSignature` case also requires an already admitted relation kind, direct governor and predicate, participant meanings, Applicability, occurrence-identity rule, and an ordinary assertion. Without that settlement, the author keeps a local claim, predicate definition, or exact missing-governor blocker instead of inventing SlotSpecs.
- Typed reuse adds authoring effort for A.6.5 relation SlotSpecs or A.6.1 operation declarations, plus A.6.0 dependency declarations only when another signature actually relies on named terms or laws.
- A change to exact claim content, EntityOfConcern, or effective reference scheme identifies another episteme even when the publication looks identical; authors must separately judge `U.Signature` membership and any claimed edition, refinement, or supersession relation.

### A.6.0:10 - Rationale

The ontic is needed because the same reusable declaration is cited across work occurrences, publication occurrences, and representations. Treating it as only a table-shaped publication form loses identity; treating it as the declared world-side object collapses episteme and EntityOfConcern.

The declaration components answer four different engineering questions. `SubjectKind`, `RangedValueKind`, and optional `ResultKind` identify the declared subject and value or result range. When slice-dependent membership is current, `SliceSet` names the addressable context slices and `ExtentRule` says how the members of the same declared kind are determined at one slice. Vocabulary supplies reusable names and, for a RelationSignature, named participant SlotSpecs; A.6.1 supplies operation arguments and results for a mechanism declaration. Laws state the reusable regularities. Applicability states where those regularities are used. Their conceptual separation is stable even when publication layout changes.

`RelationSignature` is a use of `U.Signature` because it has the same episteme identity and content duties. Introducing a second root kind would duplicate those duties while leaving obtaining and occurrence identity with direct relation patterns anyway.

Progressive elaboration protects didactic primacy. A practitioner can begin with a readable relation sentence and add formal declaration only when reuse creates value. Exactness is increased for a named claim or operation.

### A.6.0:11 - SoTA-Echoing

| Current source | What it contributes | FPF disposition and practical implication |
|---|---|---|
| JuliaHub Dyad 3.2 component and analysis documentation; Modelica 3.7 retained only as historical acausal-modeling lineage | Dyad supplies the current engineering comparator: reusable relation-first components and connections remain separate from selected analyses, solution objects, generated artifacts, and optional schematic presentation. Modelica preserves the older declarative-connection lineage. | **Adopt and generalize the separation, not either tool's ontology.** Keep the connector or relation declaration separate from a concrete assertion, analysis, generated equations or artifacts, solver Work, and diagram. FPF relation-kind admission, participant meanings, the direct predicate, applicability, and the occurrence-identity rule require an FPF direct governor. |
| The current Lean Language Reference, covering Lean `4.33.0-rc1`, describes structures through named fields whose types may depend on earlier fields, while the kernel checks formal terms independently from presentation convenience. | It supports the case 5.4 representation of the indexed result as `Vector Real n` and makes the dependence of result length on argument `n` inspectable. | **Adapt as a dependent-type representation precedent.** A.6.1 defines the argument and result meanings. The concrete Lean-to-proof-carrying-record comparison stays under A.6.3.RT unless a named lens changes the next comparison action. |
| TypeDB 3.x declares relation types through explicit related role types and can specialize those declarations. | It supports stable schema-local names as a representation precedent for declared participant positions. | **Adapt with a stricter boundary.** A.6.5 SlotSpecs are used only after the FPF relation kind and direct governor are independently settled. |
| For the RDF-validation branch, SHACL 1.2 Core (Working Draft, 30 June 2026) gives the current standards-track answer by separating shapes graphs, evaluated data graphs, validation work, and validation reports. | It supports keeping a reusable constraint declaration, evaluated data, evaluation work, and an evaluation-report episteme as different objects. | **Adapt only as a work-in-progress representation and validation precedent.** The clinical local claim and the learning A.2.4/A.10 evidence-use relation remain governed by their current FPF subject patterns. |
| For the semantic-web foundational-ontology branch, the March 2026 gUFO preprint gives a current branch answer by using reification patterns for relational aspects. | It supplies a stress question about when arity, participant dependence, and relation-occurrence reification matter. | **Reject as FPF ontology; retain only as a stress comparator.** For relation-kind admission, the direct predicate and occurrence identity, use the FPF direct governor. Apply §4.8's three receiving-use questions to decide whether a declaration or occurrence identity is needed. |

### A.6.0:12 - Relations

- **Builds on:** A.7, C.2.1, C.3, A.2.6, and A.6.5.
- **Governs:** reusable `U.Signature` declaration epistemes, including `RelationSignature` use and the FormalSubstrate and PrincipleFrame profiles.
- **Constrained by:** F.19 for the register and usability of materially changed technical declaration blocks, the mantra, checklist instructions, and worked cases. The local result must let the cold intended reader recover the claim or action, decisive governed terms, and practical use; add an ordinary explanation only when needed for that recovery. Use E.10's compact route and exact rules for unresolved lexical questions.
- **Coordinates with:** A.6.REL for relation occurrence, A.6.RCD for needed-claim derivation and relation-kind settlement before declaration, A.6.1 for mechanism declaration and realization, A.3.1 for methods, A.15.1 for work, F.9 for explicit bridge use, A.17, A.18, C.16, A.19.CPM, and A.19.UNM for characteristic, scale, comparison, and normalization questions, C.29 for mathematical-lens use, and E.24.UK for durable U-kind admission.
- **Described and published through:** C.2.1, E.17, and E.24.PUB.
