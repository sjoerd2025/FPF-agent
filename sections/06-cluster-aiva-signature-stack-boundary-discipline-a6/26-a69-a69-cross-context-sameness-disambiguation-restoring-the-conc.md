## A.6.9 - Cross-Context Sameness Disambiguation - Restoring the concrete claim behind "same", "equivalent", and "align" (RPR-XCTX)
> **Type:** Relational precision-restoration pattern; Architectural (A) — A.6.P specialisation (RPR)
> **Status:** Stable
> **Normativity:** Normative

**Use this pattern when** a document, table row, boundary statement, or publication claim uses *same*, *equivalent*, *aligned*, *mapped*, or *corresponding* in a way that may hide ordinary designation, a non-semantic lane or id claim, or a real relation between exact local senses.

**What goes wrong if missed.** A label match, explanation, ID mapping, or partial correspondence becomes global identity or a licence for an unspecified use. Direction, use rule, tolerated loss, evidence, and the actual downstream act disappear inside one umbrella word.

**What this buys.** The sentence becomes one concrete result: a same-context designation, a claim stated using its concrete predicate or constraint, an obtaining F.9 Bridge with a separate bounded-use claim when a use is proposed, or an explicit stop. A card is added only when the claims must travel.

> **Builds on:** A.6.P for relational prose repair; F.17 for exact scheme-based SenseCells; F.18 for designation; F.9 for the direct Bridge relation, profile, bounded-use boundary, and card boundary; C.2.1 for claim and description identity; F.0.1, F.7, and F.8 for sense-family and downstream naming discipline; A.7 and A.6.6 for lane and identifier dispatch
> **Coordinates with:** A.10 for evidence-provenance relations and local reliance dispositions; B.3 for assurance; E.17.0 for View membership; E.24.PUB for publication occurrence, form, and carrier; C.3.3 for the exact `KindBridge` relation and C.3.2 for a fresh target classification judgment; A.2.6 for scope operations; A.6.3.RT for representation transition; A.22 for structure; A.2.1, F.6, and A.15.1 for system-role-kind, assignment, and Work claims

Use this pattern when umbrella sameness wording could hide which exact local senses, designation, lane, identifier, scope operation, representation transition, structure relation, or proposed use is current. The trigger starts a dispatch; it does not oblige the author to assert a Bridge or complete a card.

When the remaining question is semantic, first test whether a Bridge obtains. For a proposed use of an obtaining Bridge, state the use separately in ordinary language: what someone will do, in which direction, by which correspondence rule, and how much semantic loss that use tolerates. Give that C.2.1 claim affirmative or negative polarity. F.9, A.10, and B.3 supply the exact follow-through; A.6.9 teaches the reader how to recover it from ambiguous prose.

### A.6.9:1 - Problem frame

Cross-context prose routinely compresses a multi-part claim into one adjective: *same*, *equivalent*, *align*, *map*, *matches*, or *corresponds*.

First decide whether this is a Bridge situation at all. A positive F.9 case has two exact F.17 `SchemeSenseCell` endpoints whose `<ReferenceScheme, LocalSenseClaim>` projections differ, plus an applicable relation-semantic profile whose predicate is true for those cells. Labels, identifiers, systems, mapping implementations, selected structures, cards, and publications may help identify endpoints or support the predicate; none by itself supplies a resolved endpoint or makes the profile predicate true.

If a Bridge obtains, several questions still remain independent:

* what concrete comparison, substitution, translation, explanation, publication, or other use is proposed;
* the direction of that use;
* the use-specific correspondence rule;
* the semantic-loss tolerance for that use;
* whether the C.2.1 claim about that use is affirmative or negative;
* whether current A.10 evidence or B.3 assurance supports relying on that claim;
* whether separate authorization is required; and
* whether any Work, assertion, publication, relation, operation application, or other receiving object actually occurred.

A.6.9 makes that dispatch visible. It prevents an explanation, mapping witness, score, or polished card from becoming global identity, authorization, or proof of performance.

### A.6.9:2 - Problem

When an umbrella predicate is used as if it were a complete answer, readers silently choose defaults:

* **Symmetry hallucination:** “equivalent” is read as symmetric even when the intended relation is narrower or broader.
* **Relation-to-use jump:** a true correspondence is treated as sufficient for the requested comparison or substitution.
* **Loss erasure:** “same” implies lossless transfer although units, granularity, preconditions, or stance differ.
* **Permission confusion:** “A is suitable for this comparison” is read as permission or authorization to perform it.
* **Implicit inversion:** relation symmetry is treated as two safe use directions, or endpoint order is mistaken for the safe inclusion direction.
* **Occurrence smuggling:** a named “publication use” or “mapping use” is treated as an actual publication or mapping operation.
* **Temporal incoherence:** an unpinned claim silently combines different glossary, schema, code-list, ontology, or model editions.

These are ontology and inference defects, not merely word-choice defects.

### A.6.9:3 - Forces

| Force | Pull | Push |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Brevity | One word such as “same” is fast. | It hides the object, action, direction, rule, tolerance, and stop. |
| Practical interoperability | Teams want shared labels and reusable mappings. | Shared labels and running code are not semantic identity or proof of a safe use. |
| Relation versus use | One semantic relation can remain fixed. | Different uses of it can have opposite polarity or different evidence. |
| Direction | A relation may be symmetric or oriented. | Every proposed use still has its own source-to-receiving direction. |
| Evidence evolves | Counterexamples and warrants change. | Evidence change should reopen reliance without silently reidentifying the Bridge. |
| Version drift | Canons and models change by edition. | The relation profile needs an applicability and as-of basis. |
| Practical safety | Cross-context reuse can save work. | Suitability, reliance, authorization, and actual performance must not collapse. |

### A.6.9:4 - Solution

Treat an umbrella sameness sentence as a **dispatch trigger**, not as an automatic Bridge and not as a demand for a card. Recover the concrete subject and action first. Then choose the smallest truthful branch:

1. **Ordinary designation inside one semantic bounded context.** If both expressions resolve to the same exact `<ReferenceScheme, LocalSenseClaim>` projection, use the ordinary naming pattern and stop. When only the admitted extent of that claim changes, apply A.2.6 `widen`, `narrow`, or `refit`. No F.9 Bridge is current.
2. **Lane or reference-plane repair.** If the sentence confuses Object, Description, Carrier, or `CHR:ReferencePlane`, restore the exact kinds under A.7 or the governing plane rule.
3. **Identification or indexing.** If the sentence means same id, key, code, or index target, use A.6.6. Identifier equality does not establish meaning correspondence.
4. **Scope operation.** A.2.6 is the pattern for `widen`, `narrow`, `refit`, and `translate` over exact scope values; when the sentence concerns claim extent, recover the exact `U.ClaimScope`. `translate` may consume an independently obtaining F.9 Bridge and a separate affirmative claim for that exact direction, rule, and tolerance; it is neither representation Work nor a structure crossing.
5. **Other locality hidden by context wording.** Route interpretation to the effective `U.ReferenceScheme`; claim extent to `U.ClaimScope`; empirical grounding to one exact `EpistemeEmpiricalGroundingRelation`; time to the qualification window required by the temporal predicate; project wording to an exact composite `U.Work` under A.15.6; viewpoint use to the E.17.0 viewpoint relation and one `U.ViewpointRef` resolving exact P; and any world-side subject claim to the pattern that defines its relation predicate and obtaining condition. A bare context word supplies none of these governed objects or claims.
6. **Representation transition.** A representation change is not a Bridge. For ordinary A.6.3.RT use, name the same concern, content to survive, target representation, source comparison, admissible use boundary, and source-return trigger and destination. When cross-scheme dependency or reliance makes exact claim identity material, independently constitute source episteme `X` and receiving episteme `Y`, require `EntityOfConcern(X)=EntityOfConcern(Y)` exactly, and state exact `v : X -> Y` with scheme relation, preservation, loss, and prohibited strengthening. Assert `RepresentationSchemeTransitionRelation@Context` only when every six-participant obtaining condition and actual dated representation-transformation Work are present; performed Work alone neither proves `v` nor makes that relation obtain. A Bridge supplies neither `v` nor the Work and makes no transition occurrence obtain.
7. **Structure comparison or crossing.** Recover each exact `BoundedModelUseStructure` independently, then apply the conditional A.22 cross-structure rule in §4.8 only if exact governed subject crossings and a named receiving use remain. A SenseCell Bridge, label, diagram, shared participant, or reference supplies neither structure selection nor crossing; without an exact direct crossing governor, return the A.6.RCD missing-governor stop.
8. **Cross-local semantic relation.** Resolve two exact F.17 `SchemeSenseCell` values from different semantic bounded contexts, declare the F.9 relation-semantic profile, and cite a Bridge only when its predicate obtains. Scheme difference, same spelling, a mapping witness, or two endpoint references alone establishes no Bridge.
9. **Proposed use of an obtaining Bridge.** In a second sentence, name action `u`, direction `d`, use-specific rule `r`, tolerated loss `t`, and claim polarity under C.2.1. When someone will rely on that claim, recover A.10 or B.3 reliance for the same use.
10. **Explanation or unresolved proposal.** Say plainly what remains unestablished. A candidate or negative card carries no positive occurrence reference.
11. **Claim that the use happened.** Name the actual receiving object and use the rule that defines the claim about that object; the use position inside the C.2.1 claim is not that object.

For A.6.9, **semantic bounded context** is a Plain practice name for the local interpretation basis recovered from one exact cell's `<ReferenceScheme, LocalSenseClaim>` projection. It supplies only that interpretation basis; each receiving object or relation remains governed by the applicable branch above. Representation transition, A.2.6 scope translation, F.9 local-sense Bridge, and direct structure crossing remain four independently governed moves.

#### A.6.9:4.0 - Trigger and endpoint recovery

Open the dispatch when **same**, **identical**, **equivalent**, **align**, **map**, **match**, **correspond**, *treat as*, *reuse*, *share*, *unify*, *canonical source*, *synced*, *normalized*, *one-to-one*, *same ID*, or *mirrors* could hide the current object or action. Apply equivalent triggers in any language.

If the dispatch leaves a semantic-correspondence question, resolve the local senses before deciding whether a Bridge is current. A shared semantic-context projection still exits through ordinary designation. Each candidate endpoint reference must be a `SenseCellAddressRef` resolving one exact F.17 `SchemeSenseCell`. Keep the cell distinct from each C.2.1 description episteme about it, each F.18 designator, and each address reference. A reference resolves the cell, a designator names it, and a description claims something about it; only the cell fills the Bridge endpoint. A string, system, table, class name, file, context label, card, or identifier may be the source expression or a neighboring evidence object from which that cell is recovered. If a token is metonymic — *the system*, *the model*, *the service*, *that table* — test only governed referents that a plausible intended reader could recover from the local span, then recover the intended local expression and claim. If either endpoint remains unresolved, keep the sentence explanatory and return `unresolved SenseCell endpoint`.

Pin the endpoint reference-scheme and local-sense-claim editions, or an exact as-of basis, when the correspondence can change with a canon or model edition. `Γ_time` may be used as a compact card label for that basis. It is not a participant. It contributes to profile identity only when it states the profile's exact applicability or as-of basis.

Before testing a Bridge, check ontological strata. C.3.3 establishes only the exact `KindBridge` between source and target local kinds. C.3.2 makes a fresh target classification judgment under the target `KindSignature` edition and slice. Use the pattern that defines the measurement claim for value normalization, A.2.1 for system-role assignment, F.6 for performed-Work attribution, E.24.PUB for publication occurrence, form, and carrier, and A.6.3.RT for representation transition. F.9 can supply a semantic premise needed by one of those claims; each neighboring claim obtains only under its named subject pattern.

#### A.6.9:4.1 - Stable lens: relation, use claim, reliance, and receiving object

Keep these objects distinct:

1. **Bridge occurrence.** The direct relation has exactly two F.17 cell participants and obtains under one exact F.9 profile.
2. **BridgePredicateProfile.** It contains only Bridge kind, kind-defined symmetry or orientation, endpoint-sense readings, relation-specific correspondence or difference condition, applicability and as-of basis, Boolean truth condition, and stop dependencies.
3. **Bounded-use claim.** An ordinary C.2.1 claim says whether the exact obtaining Bridge is suitable for `<u,d,r,t>`. Its EntityOfConcern is the Bridge; its ClaimGraph designates the use, direction, rule, tolerance, and polarity; its effective scheme interprets them.
4. **Optional Bridge Card.** It packages claims and evidence when durable reuse pays. It neither creates the relation nor grants the use.
5. **Separately governed receiving object.** If the use happened, its Work, assertion, publication, direct relation, operation application, or other object keeps its own participants, obtaining or performance condition, and identity.

```text
Bridge(SourceSenseCell, ReceivingSenseCell; BridgePredicateProfile)
```

Use that notation only after the F.9 predicate passes. For a proposal, write `candidate Bridge(...)` or use a candidate card with no positive occurrence reference.

Changing `u`, `d`, `r`, or `t` changes the bounded-use claim, not the Bridge. Changing evidence, an A.10 relation or local `RelianceDisposition`, or a B.3 claim, record, or disposition reopens reliance without reidentifying the Bridge or the bounded-use claim. A changed endpoint or relation-semantic profile identifies another Bridge candidate.

#### A.6.9:4.2 - Explicit claim skeleton

Use this table for the semantic branch. The action, direction, rule, and tolerance rows apply only to a proposed use of an obtaining Bridge.


| Item | When required | Meaning and stop |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| `SourceSenseCellRef`, `ReceivingSenseCellRef` | every Bridge candidate | Exact F.17 addresses; unresolved endpoints stop the semantic branch. |
| semantic-context projections | every Bridge candidate | Derived `<ReferenceScheme, LocalSenseClaim>` pairs; they must differ for F.9. |
| `BridgePredicateProfile` | every Bridge candidate | Exact by-value relation semantics only; a label or id is insufficient. |
| `BridgeKind` and relation orientation | profile and readable explanation | What semantic correspondence or difference is claimed; not a use licence. |
| applicability / `Γ_time`, truth condition, dependencies | profile | When and how the direct predicate is tested; missing dependencies stop without inventing an occurrence. |
| action `u` | every proposed use | What the reader proposes to compare, substitute, translate, publish, or otherwise do. |
| direction `d` | every proposed use | Exact use-source to use-receiving order; relation symmetry supplies no direction by implication. |
| rule `r` | every proposed use | The correspondence rule the action will follow. |
| tolerance `t` | every proposed use | Which semantic loss is acceptable for this action; observed loss remains evidence. |
| polarity and effective ReferenceScheme | every bounded-use claim | Whether the claim is affirmative or negative and how its designations are interpreted. |
| A.10 or B.3 branch | when someone will rely on the claim | The exact evidence-provenance relation plus local disposition, or the B.3 claim or explicit disposition selected by its trigger. |
| permission result | only when permission is required | Cite the exact A.2.8.PER result the use needs: an obtaining strong grant, weak non-prohibition finding, exercise relation, or conflict result. Policy and predicates supply grounds; they are not that result. |
| receiving-object ref | only when the use is said to have happened | Exact Work, assertion, publication, relation, application, or other object under its subject pattern. |
| `ClaimMode` and card EntityOfConcern | only when a card pays | Actual card concerns the obtaining Bridge; candidate or negative card concerns the admitted F.9 Bridge relation kind and carries proposed endpoints and profile in its ClaimGraph. |

Only the two endpoint cells fill the direct relation's participant slots. Use content is ClaimGraph content, not another relation participant or profile component.

#### A.6.9:4.3 - Judgement and change

Choose the least-committing truthful Bridge kind: `Equivalence`, `Narrower-than`, `Broader-than`, `Partial-overlap`, `Disjoint`, or one declared cross-family relation kind. The kind settles relation semantics only.

If a Bridge obtains and a use is proposed, judge that use separately:

* `Partial-overlap` can support an affirmative label-use claim when its exact rule preserves the named differences; the Bridge does not grant that use automatically.
* `Disjoint` can support a contrastive explanation; a proposed substitution receives negative polarity.
* `Equivalence` is symmetric, but `A -> B` and `B -> A` are different use claims.
* `Narrower-than` and `Broader-than` orient the semantic relation. Narrower-to-broader is usually easier to warrant, but every use direction still needs its own rule, tolerance, and polarity; recover reliance when someone will rely on that claim.
* A broader-to-narrower proposal normally requires refined cells and a separately tested Bridge. Another profile over the same broad endpoints cannot make an unsafe use safe by declaration.
* Type-structure reuse requires a separate claim naming the structural rule and loss tolerance. Matched invariants can support that claim; no `CL` number grants it.

`CL` may remain optional evidence shorthand: `0` contradicted, `1` weakly comparable, `2` bounded support with counterexamples, `3` matched stated invariants with no current material counterexample. It is neither profile identity nor a suitability threshold.

Narrate changes by the object that changed:

1. `retargetEndpoint` for another source or receiving cell;
2. `replaceBridgeProfile` for changed relation-semantic content;
3. `reviseBoundedUseClaim` for changed `u`, `d`, `r`, `t`, effective scheme, or polarity;
4. `retestObtaining` for changed endpoint facts or dependencies under the fixed profile;
5. `reopenReliance` for changed evidence, currentness, A.10 relation or disposition, or B.3 claim, record, or disposition;
6. `reviseBridgeCard` for changed package content;
7. `publishBridgeCardEdition` for a publication occurrence; and
8. `recoverReceivingObject` when the use is claimed to have happened.

An inverse asymmetric relation and any direct A-to-C relation require their own profiles and tests. Two chained Bridges do not entail a third.

#### A.6.9:4.4 - Lexical guardrails

In normative or decision-carrying prose, replace the umbrella word with a sentence that exposes the action and stop:

| Intended meaning | Plain action | Exact follow-through |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ordinary same-context designation | “Both expressions designate this local sense.” | Cite the common projection and naming pattern; no Bridge. |
| cross-family semantic interpretation | “Use A to explain B; do not substitute it.” | Test the cross-family Bridge. Use it for explanation only when it obtains and a separate affirmative explanation-use claim states its nearest non-use. |
| naming convenience | “Use the label ‘actor’ in this comparison; keep account and customer eligibility distinct.” | Obtaining Bridge plus a C.2.1 claim naming direction, label rule, and zero tolerance for eligibility transfer. |
| directional substitution | “For calculation X, read A as B by rule R within tolerance T; do not reverse it.” | Obtaining Bridge, affirmative claim for `<X,A->B,R,T>`, and current A.10 or B.3 reliance. |
| type-structure reuse | “Reuse this subtype row only while invariants I remain true and loss stays within T.” | Obtaining Bridge plus a separately warranted structural-use claim. |
| contrast | “These senses differ in this stated way; do not substitute them.” | Obtaining `Disjoint` or `Partial-overlap` Bridge plus negative substitution-use polarity. |
| unresolved proposal | “The mapping is available, but the semantic relation is not established.” | Candidate card or plain stop naming the missing endpoint, predicate fact, or dependency. |

Plain teaching prose may retain *same*, *align*, or *map* when the local sentence tells the reader what to do and what result would reopen the claim. Add a non-inference only when a plausible intended reader could otherwise overread the sentence and the guard changes understanding or action.

#### A.6.9:4.5 - Disambiguation guide

| Trigger | First question | Default route | Stop |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| “A is the same as B” | Same local sense or relation between distinct senses? | designation first; otherwise least-committing F.9 kind | no exact cells or predicate -> explanatory only |
| “Align A and B” | Shared label, comparison, substitution, or structure use? | name the proposed action; test F.9 only if a semantic-correspondence claim remains | mapping score alone establishes neither relation nor use |
| “Map A to B” | Semantic reading or operational transformation? | operational only: use its defining operation rule, with Work only when performance is claimed; semantic as well: keep code or ETL as potential evidence and test F.9 | code direction is not use suitability |
| “Same ID/key/one-to-one” | Identifier relation or meaning relation? | A.6.6 first | collision-free ids do not establish sense identity |
| “B is a view/projection of A” | View membership, representation, or sense reuse? | E.17.0, C.29, or representation pattern first | dropped constraints block stronger use claims |
| “Equivalent” | What relation, action, direction, rule, and tolerance? | test overlap or inclusion before equivalence | symmetry alone grants no use |

#### A.6.9:4.6 - Mapping witnesses are not Bridges

A lookup table, aligner model, transformation function, API, or ETL step is an implementation or evidence object. It may support the claim that a Bridge obtains or that one bounded use is suitable. It does not determine either claim by itself. Code may run `A -> B` while the semantic Bridge is symmetric, oriented the other way, or absent; and even an obtaining Bridge may be unsuitable for that operation's rule or tolerance.

When the mapping witness is used to support a semantic-correspondence claim, keep it in the A.10 evidence path or optional card. Test the F.9 predicate; if a Bridge obtains and a use is proposed, state the C.2.1 bounded-use claim and recover reliance when someone will rely on that claim.

#### A.6.9:4.7 - Coordination boundaries

- **Naming and endpoint objects:** F.18 selects designators; F.17 governs exact scheme-based cells and rows. A `SchemeSenseCell`, C.2.1 description episteme, designator, and resolving reference remain distinct; none creates a Bridge.
- **Reference scheme and scope:** C.2.1 is the pattern for the effective `U.ReferenceScheme`; A.2.6 is the pattern for `U.ClaimScope`, `widen`, `narrow`, `refit`, and `translate`. A.2.6 translation may consume an exact Bridge plus its affirmative bounded-use claim but is not representation Work or structure crossing.
- **Grounding:** C.2.1 alone supplies an `EpistemeEmpiricalGroundingRelation`. Its grounding holon is the participant against which covered empirical claims are grounded; it is not assumed identical to the episteme's EntityOfConcern.
- **Time:** the qualification window is part of the exact temporal or subject predicate and assertion. F.9 profile applicability or `Γ_time` does not become a generic context or time participant for another claim.
- **Project wording:** A.15.6 recovers an actual project as one exact composite `U.Work` after A.15.1 admission and exact work parthood. Project label, plan, situation word, or Bridge supplies no project identity.
- **Viewpoint:** E.17.0 governs the direct `EpistemeViewpointConformanceRelation`; one `U.ViewpointRef` resolves exact viewpoint episteme P. The viewpoint, its reference, candidate/View episteme, and evaluator remain distinct.
- **Evidence and assurance:** A.10 is the pattern for evidence provenance and local reliance; B.3 is the pattern for assurance claims, records, and explicit dispositions.
- **Representations and publications:** E.17.0 is the pattern for conformance-dependent View membership, E.24.PUB is the pattern for publication occurrence/form/carrier, and C.29 is the pattern for mathematical-representation objects. A.6.3.RT starts an ordinary same-concern representation move with content to survive, source comparison, loss, admissible use, and the source-return trigger and destination; its triggered exact construction independently identifies `X`, `Y`, and `v`; actual representation-transformation Work is required only for the six-participant occurrence.
- **Kinds and classifications:** C.3.3 establishes the exact `KindBridge` between source and target local kinds. C.3.2 separately judges the candidate under the target kind, target `KindSignature` edition, and target slice; the result may be `true`, `false`, or `unknown`. F.9 supplies only local-sense correspondence needed by that use.
- **Structures:** A.1.1/A.22 independently select each exact `BoundedModelUseStructure`; §4.8 applies the descriptive A.22 conditional cross-structure rule only after exact governed crossings and all four structure discriminators are recoverable. A SenseCell Bridge cannot substitute for that architecture.
- **Direct subject relations, Work, and system-role claims:** every world-side relation has its own exact predicate, participant bindings, and assertion. A.2.1, F.6, A.15.1, and A.15.6 define assignment and exact performed or composite Work predicates; semantic relation, context wording, and use claim have no enactment effect.
- **Permission:** apply A.2.8.PER and cite the exact result the proposed use needs—an obtaining strong grant, weak non-prohibition finding, exercise relation, or conflict result. Policy and direct predicates supply conditions or grounds but are not the permission result. Any required authority relation remains separate.

#### A.6.9:4.8 - Structure comparison and conditional cross-structure selection

Use this branch only when the receiving question depends on the organization of actual subject crossings among several bounded model-use structures. First recover every participating `BoundedModelUseStructure` independently under A.1.1/A.22: one exact model episteme, its admitted model-use holons, the exact obtaining applicability, actual-use, and fixed-content model-expression-coherence occurrences, the exact applied constraint claims, and one named bounded-model-use frame. A shared system, model, episteme, scope, or other participant does not merge two selected structures and proves neither overlap nor parthood.

Next enumerate every actually obtaining subject-crossing occurrence selected for the proposed organization. For each one, name its exact participants, relation kind and predicate, direction when asymmetric, applicability, obtaining result, occurrence identity, and recurrence rule, and test them against the pattern that defines those relation rules. An F.9 Bridge relates exact local senses only. Context labels, edge labels, Cards, registry rows, references, Views, diagrams, and common participants may help locate the proposed crossing's objects or evidence; only an occurrence satisfying its direct governor establishes that crossing. If no current pattern defines a required crossing, stop through A.6.RCD at the exact missing-governor question; do not replace it with a vague edge family.

Only then apply A.22's conditional cross-structure rule for one named receiving or crossing-analysis use. Declare the substrate as the exact independently selected `BoundedModelUseStructure` values; the selected relation organization as the exact obtaining crossing occurrences; the exact applied constraints and invariants; and the use frame as the question, admissible action, and forbidden overread. Those are the four A.22 discriminators. The A.22-local label `CrossContextRelationStructure` serves only as a retrieval aid under that rule; A.6.9 gives it no public-vocabulary use. The resulting `U.Structure` is the dependent organization identified by those four discriminators. Container or holon identity, context grouping, and the crossing occurrences remain governed separately. Any `U.View`, Context Map, diagram, Card, or publication that depicts, packages, or carries the organization retains its own identity and relation to it.

When a load-bearing claim says that this organization was selected, separately name the selecting system, exact Method, dated selection `U.Work`, and direct participation relations or A.6.1 bindings. Name the exact selection judgment and its result: when persistence is needed, a C.2.1 result episteme whose exact EntityOfConcern is the selected structure; when an accountable choice is claimed, the exact decision and its direct decision governor. A generic result reference, the dated selection Work, and visible mapping artifacts may designate or warrant the selection claim only through the named relations. They remain outside the structure's four discriminators, and every crossing still obtains only under its direct governor.

### A.6.9:5 - Archetypal Grounding

#### A.6.9:5.1 - System archetype: IAM User and CRM Customer

The ambiguous sentence is: “An IAM User is the same as a CRM Customer.”

Treat this as a schematic hypothetical illustration. The abbreviated endpoint readings are:

- `SenseCell(IAMRoleReferenceScheme-v3, User-human-or-service-account-role)`;
- `SenseCell(CRMRoleReferenceScheme-v5, Customer-commercial-party-role)`.

These sketches name the intended scheme editions and sense readings. A full case must still resolve each `<ReferenceScheme by value, LocalExpression, LocalSenseClaim>` value, with `User` and `Customer` as the respective local expressions.

For the illustration, assume that the local meanings share some human cases, while service accounts and prospects provide cases excluded by the opposite reading. These are additional hypothetical premises, not facts recovered from the ambiguous sentence. Profile `P-IAM-CRM-OVERLAP-v2` states the symmetric `Partial-overlap` relation, exact endpoint readings, overlap and difference conditions, edition basis, truth condition, and required membership evidence. The example additionally stipulates that the profile applies and its predicate is true, and therefore uses `b-iam-crm` as an obtaining Bridge. The profile description lists what a full test needs; it does not supply that test or its evidence.

Now state the use separately. Dashboard team proposes `u-actor-label`: render IAM users as “actors” in a CRM-oriented comparison. Direction `d-iam-crm` is IAM-to-CRM dashboard reading. Rule `r-actor` keeps account eligibility and customer eligibility visible as separate columns. Tolerance `t-actor` allows the shared label but no eligibility, assignment, workflow, or Work inference. A C.2.1 claim about `b-iam-crm` is affirmative for `<u-actor-label,d-iam-crm,r-actor,t-actor>`.

Reliance on that claim remains conditional on the exact A.10 evidence-provenance relation and `RelianceDisposition=pass` for the named dashboard comparison. A hypothetical passing result would be an additional example premise, not a result recovered from the endpoint sketches. It would not authorize data processing, create a system-role assignment, or prove that a dashboard publication occurred. Reverse label reuse is another bounded-use claim even though the Bridge relation is symmetric.

An optional actual card may package the Bridge claim, this bounded-use claim, observed counterexamples, the A.10 path and disposition, currentness, and nearest non-use. Its EntityOfConcern is `b-iam-crm`; the card neither creates the relation nor performs the dashboard work.

If a later workflow isolates `HumanVerifiedUser` and `VerifiedCustomer`, refine both cells and test another Bridge. A stronger use claim over the broad cells cannot repair a false or unsuitable predicate.

#### A.6.9:5.2 - Episteme archetype: Person in two knowledge-graph schemes

The sentence is: “Person in KG-A is equivalent to Person in KG-B.” The named readings are `Person-including-fictional` under KG-A v4 and `Person-real-with-external-id` under KG-B v7. Sherlock Holmes illustrates the fictional-person distinction; the external-id rule adds another membership condition. These cues establish neither `Partial-overlap` nor inclusion.

To test `Partial-overlap`, recover the exact membership definitions and a common admissible case, an A-only case and a B-only case. To test inclusion, establish the chosen proper-inclusion predicate from those definitions and case facts; the short labels do not supply it. Until then, stop and name the missing membership definition or case fact. No exact overlap Bridge is asserted by this sketch.

The two proposed uses remain conditional illustrations. If an exact Bridge obtains, a glossary comparison that labels both rows “Person” while displaying the fiction and external-id differences can receive affirmative polarity only for a stated direction, correspondence rule and loss tolerance, with a warranted A.10 result when relied on. A type-structure merge receives negative polarity only when its exact direction and merging rule cannot preserve membership and its tolerance permits no such loss. Those rule and case premises still have to be supplied.

When their basis is supplied, both claims concern the same obtaining Bridge; neither changes its identity. Refining KG-A into `RealPerson` and `FictionalPerson` changes an endpoint and opens a new Bridge test.

#### A.6.9:5.3 - Published NAICS language and a `Conformist` cue

Start with separate objects. C.2.1 identifies exact model episteme edition `NAICS-2022-ClassificationEpisteme` by its exact ClaimGraph, EntityOfConcern, and effective ReferenceScheme; A.1 independently identifies exact `IndustryClassificationApplication-7 : U.System`. If availability matters, E.24.PUB separately tests `EpistemePublicationRelation(NAICS-2022-ClassificationEpisteme, ClassificationAudienceDeclaration-2, ClassificationUseDeclaration-5, NAICS-2022-TableForm, NAICS-2022-PDFCarrier)` together with its exact form-expression and form-bearing occurrences. The episteme, publication occurrence, form, carrier, declarations, and application system keep different identities. Publication establishes availability to the exact audience and use declarations. Access, adoption, applicability, actual use, performed Work, and any application-side parthood remain claims under their own predicates and facts.

Recover the use branch before selecting structure. Require `HolderSystem(ClassificationAssignment-3)=IndustryClassificationApplication-7`, exact F.6 `performedUnderAssignment(ClassificationWork-4, ClassificationAssignment-3)`, and the application's actual use of the selected NAICS content during that Work concerning exact `ClassifiedOrganization-42`; only then may `ModelUseRelation(ClassificationAssignment-3, NAICS-2022-ClassificationEpisteme, ClassificationWork-4, ClassifiedOrganization-42)` obtain. A positive `NAICSClassificationModelUseStructure` additionally requires exact `ModelApplicabilityRelation(NAICS-2022-ClassificationEpisteme, ClassifiedOrganization-42, ClassificationClaimScope)`, fixed-content coherence with the exact classification-expression episteme under a declared predicate and ReferenceScheme, exact applied constraint claims naming the edition and classification distinctions to preserve, and `NAICSClassificationFrame`: “Which NAICS edition and distinctions govern the classification of `ClassifiedOrganization-42` as a complete organization?” Model use comes from the actual-use facts above; any application-system parthood claim requires its own predicate and facts. Without the complete A.1.1/A.22 basis, stop at publication availability or the exact direct relation that does obtain.

Treat DDD *Conformist* only as a Plain cue to a proposed directed subject dependency. Preserve the exact proposed source, target, direction, adoption condition, dependency predicate, update authority, required preserved meaning, permitted loss, claim scope, and standard-edition basis. A positive occurrence would additionally require exact participant meanings and fillers, its direct relation kind and predicate, obtaining and applicability conditions, occurrence identity and recurrence, all supplied by one compatible direct subject governor. The label, published-language status, table edge, and selected structure may cue or represent the proposal; only a compatible direct subject governor supplies its predicate and occurrence rules. When no such governor is current, return `missing CROSS-LOCALITY-BRIDGE governor`.

An F.9 Bridge may separately obtain between exact NAICS-side and application-side `SchemeSenseCell` values and may support one bounded interpretation claim. Adoption, dependency, update authority, preservation of application meaning, and a subject-crossing occurrence remain separately governed claims. A later NAICS edition is a distinct C.2.1 episteme. Before `NAICSClassificationModelUseStructure` is selected for that edition, establish applicability, actual use, coherence, preservation, loss, and any governed crossing for the exact edition. Republishing unchanged claims in another form or carrier changes the publication objects only; it does not establish the application's use of another episteme edition.

### A.6.9:6 - Bias-Annotation

This pattern is biased toward:

* **Explicit action over fluent ambiguity.** It slows only sentences that would otherwise hide what someone will do.
* **Relation-use separation.** One Bridge can support several independently tested uses without becoming a licence.
* **Locality of meaning.** Exact scheme and local-sense claims provide the interpretation basis without a reified context bearer.
* **Evidence humility.** Scores, counterexamples, and invariants inform claims and reliance but do not manufacture relation truth or permission.

The dispatch stays cheap: same-context designation and direct-relation cases stop before F.9. The heavier path is reserved for a cross-local relation that a named use will actually consume.

### A.6.9:7 - Conformance Checklist

A repaired sentence or boundary statement conforms iff:

1. **Concrete action.** The reader can say what object, comparison, substitution, translation, publication, or other action is at issue.
2. **Use the specific patterns before testing a Bridge.** First apply the pattern that defines, constrains, or tests each effective reference scheme, claim scope, grounding, qualification window, exact composite project Work, viewpoint, representation transition, selected structure, direct subject relation, lane, identifier, system-role kind, assignment, or Work claim.
3. **Exact endpoints.** Every Bridge candidate uses two F.17 cell addresses resolving exact values.
4. **No context proxy.** Semantic bounded context is the Plain local interpretation basis recovered from the endpoint projection; it is not a project situation, model-use structure, scope, grounding, time, viewpoint, identity, or direct relation participant.
5. **Direct Bridge truth.** A positive occurrence appears only after the exact profile applies, its predicate is true, and dependencies are present.
6. **Profile boundary.** Profile identity contains relation semantics only, with no use, tolerance, polarity, reliance, authorization, or receiving object.
7. **Separate use claim.** Every proposed use of an obtaining Bridge names `u`, `d`, `r`, `t`, polarity, and effective scheme in a C.2.1 claim about the exact Bridge.
8. **Evidence honesty.** Observed loss and mapping witnesses stay in evidence; permitted loss stays in the bounded-use claim; `CL` grants nothing.
9. **Reliance branch.** Current reliance follows A.10 or B.3 for the same use and does not become authorization.
10. **Receiving-object boundary.** Any claim that the use happened names the actual object and states the concrete claim using the rule that defines its predicate.
11. **Card boundary.** Actual, candidate, and negative cards use the correct EntityOfConcern and never create a Bridge or receiving occurrence.
12. **Change honesty.** Endpoint, profile, use claim, reliance, card, publication, and receiving-object changes remain distinct.
13. **No inferred inverse or composition.** An asymmetric inverse, opposite use direction, or direct A-to-C Bridge gets its own exact judgement.
14. **Practical result.** The final sentence tells the reader what to do and what condition would stop or reopen the result. It adds a non-inference only when a plausible intended reader could otherwise overread the sentence and the guard changes understanding or action.
15. **Same-locality route.** Same projection uses ordinary designation and, when claim extent changes, A.2.6 `widen`, `narrow`, or `refit`; it does not mint a Bridge.
16. **RT boundary.** An ordinary A.6.3.RT note states the same concern, preserved content, representation delta, loss, admissible use, and source-return trigger and destination. A triggered exact construction adds exact `X`, `Y`, and `v`; actual representation-transformation Work enters only when the six-participant occurrence is asserted. None is scope translation or a Bridge.
17. **Structure boundary.** Each participating `BoundedModelUseStructure` is independently selected; every selected subject crossing satisfies the predicate and obtaining condition defined for that relation, with its participants and occurrence identity explicit; and the conditional A.22 cross-structure selection names exact substrate, relation organization, applied constraints and invariants, and receiving-use frame. When a load-bearing selection claim is current, also recover the separate selection-work and judgment basis under §4.8; identify a result episteme when persistence is needed and an exact governed decision when an accountable choice is claimed. Missing relation law returns the A.6.RCD missing-governor stop; shared participants, labels, references, Views, diagrams, Cards, and generic result refs establish none of these facts.
18. **Grounding and endpoint distinctions.** Grounding holon and EntityOfConcern are not assumed identical; every SenseCell, description episteme, designator, and reference remains distinct.
19. **Published-model crossing stop.** The NAICS replay independently identifies the exact episteme edition and application system, keeps E.24.PUB occurrence/form/carrier separate, recovers applicability and actual model use before structure selection, and treats *Conformist* as a proposal only. If the receiving use selects another edition, establish applicability, actual use, coherence, preservation, loss, and any governed crossing for that exact episteme before selecting the structure. A positive adoption, dependency, or update-authority crossing requires a current pattern that defines its predicate, obtaining condition, and identity rule; an F.9 Bridge or publication evidence may support but does not supply that governor.

### A.6.9:8 - Common Anti-Patterns and How to Avoid Them

| ID | Anti-pattern | Failure | Repair |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `AP-XCTX-1` | Bridge by adjective | *Same* or *aligned* hides relation and action. | Name the action; dispatch it; test F.9 only if semantic correspondence remains. |
| `AP-XCTX-2` | Scheme difference becomes relation | Two schemes differ, so a Bridge is presumed. | Treat difference as a trigger only; establish the direct predicate. |
| `AP-XCTX-3` | Profile as use licence | Direction, rule, or tolerated loss is embedded in profile identity. | Move it to the separate C.2.1 bounded-use claim. |
| `AP-XCTX-4` | Bridge-alone substitution | An obtaining Bridge is cited as sufficient for a use. | Require the affirmative bounded-use claim and current A.10 or B.3 reliance. |
| `AP-XCTX-5` | Mapping witness becomes semantics | A lookup, score, or ETL path proves the relation or use. | Keep it as evidence and test both propositions explicitly. |
| `AP-XCTX-6` | String or id becomes endpoint | A word, file, id, or system fills a SenseCell slot. | Resolve the exact F.17 cell; handle ids under A.6.6. |
| `AP-XCTX-7` | Symmetry grants two use directions | One symmetric occurrence is read as two licences. | State each direction in its own use claim. |
| `AP-XCTX-8` | Loss note becomes tolerance | An observed difference is assumed acceptable. | Keep it in evidence and name accepted loss as `t`. |
| `AP-XCTX-9` | Confidence laundering | Higher `CL` or reviewer approval grants a use. | Treat `CL` as evidence shorthand and recover claim polarity plus reliance. |
| `AP-XCTX-10` | Suitability becomes permission | An affirmative semantic claim is read as authorization. | Apply A.2.8.PER and cite the needed grant, non-prohibition, exercise, or conflict result; if it is absent or unresolved, state that exact result. |
| `AP-XCTX-11` | Named use becomes occurrence | “Publication use” is treated as a publication. | Recover the exact publication occurrence under E.24.PUB, or recover another receiving object and cite the pattern that defines it. |
| `AP-XCTX-12` | Chain upgrade | A-to-B and B-to-C become direct A-to-C equivalence. | Test a direct A-to-C Bridge and composite use independently. |
| `AP-XCTX-13` | Timeless or facetless claim | Edition or compared facet stays hidden. | State applicability and refine endpoint readings. |
| `AP-XCTX-14` | Kernel promotion | A strong Bridge is used to admit one global U-kind. | Apply E.24.UK and A.11 independently. |

### A.6.9:9 - Consequences

* **Pros**

  * Turns ambiguous sameness into a visible relation question and a visible action question.
  * Lets one Bridge remain stable while use direction, tolerance, evidence, and polarity change.
  * Prevents scores, cards, assurance, and publications from becoming hidden permission or occurrence.
  * Gives authors exact local stops instead of a vague “not equivalent”.

* **Cons**

  * A positive use normally needs two sentences instead of one adjective.
  * Reviewers must inspect the correspondence rule, tolerated loss, and evidence for the named action.
  * Many attractive “same” claims become only an explanatory comparison or a negative use claim.

**Adoption test (PRAG).** Take one sentence containing *same*, *equivalent*, *align*, or *map*. A practitioner passes when they can name the concrete action and state the truthful result of the selected branch. A non-semantic result uses its concrete predicate or constraint and exits before F.9.

For a semantic-correspondence question, resolve the local senses and decide whether the F.9 branch applies. If it does, recover the exact cells and profile and say whether the Bridge obtains. Distinguish a false predicate result or an inapplicable case from missing facts or a missing governor. Only a proposed use of an obtaining Bridge additionally needs the separate bounded-use claim and, when someone will rely on it, the applicable reliance result. Name any required authorization or claimed receiving occurrence that remains missing. If the wording prevents recovery, keep it explanatory and name the exact missing meaning; a complete false test is not missing information.

### A.6.9:10 - Rationale

Cross-context sameness wording is not one predicate. A.6.9 first restores the actual question and states designation, lane, id, scope, representation, structure, system-role-kind, assignment, and Work claims in ordinary language using their concrete rules. Add exact C.2.1 assertion and `ClaimGraph` identity only when a later use must carry or compare one of those claims independently. Only a remaining cross-local semantic question uses the F.9 Bridge predicate.

For that branch, exact cells and a relation-only profile make correspondence falsifiable. A separate C.2.1 claim makes the proposed use equally explicit without reidentifying the Bridge. A.10 or B.3 can reopen reliance without changing either object. Authorization and the actual receiving object remain visible rather than hiding inside *suitable*, *aligned*, or *mapped*.

The repair sequence is therefore: **name the action and route the object; for a remaining semantic-correspondence question, test F.9; for a proposed use of an obtaining Bridge, state the use claim and check reliance when someone will rely on it; recover permission or performance only when claimed.**

### A.6.9:11 - SoTA-Echoing

(informative; post-2015 alignment)

| SoTA practice | Primary source | What A.6.9 echoes | What A.6.9 adds | Stance |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Correspondences between viewpoints | ISO/IEC/IEEE 42010:2022 | Correspondence is not identity and retains intent and constraints. | Separates the direct semantic relation from each proposed use and actual publication or view object. | **Adopt + specialise** |
| Declarative validation shapes | W3C SHACL (2017) | Make implicit conditions testable. | Uses a profile for relation truth, a claim for bounded-use suitability, and a card only for packaging. | **Adapt** |
| Scored entity alignment with error analysis | BootEA (Sun et al., 2018) | Alignment evidence is graded and fallible. | Keeps scores and counterexamples as evidence rather than relation identity or a use licence. | **Adapt** |
| Textual entity matching | BERT-INT (Tang et al., 2020); Ditto (Li et al., 2021) | Matchers yield conditional, error-prone correspondences. | Requires exact endpoint readings, a falsifiable Bridge predicate, and a separate action-specific claim. | **Adopt conceptually** |
| Heterogeneous schema matching | SMAT (Zhang et al., 2021) | “Match” covers several relation types. | Distinguishes relation kind, relation orientation, proposed-use direction, rule, and tolerance. | **Adapt** |
| Human-in-the-loop matching | Mudgal et al. (SIGMOD 2018) | Scores require abstention and curated error cases. | Uses the exact A.10 evidence or B.3 assurance predicates and preserves explicit negative or blocked outcomes. | **Adapt** |

### A.6.9:12 - Relations

* **Specialises:** A.6.P by restoring the concrete object and action hidden by cross-context sameness wording.
* **Uses:** F.17 exact `SchemeSenseCell` identity; F.9 Bridge participants, relation-only profile, obtaining, occurrence identity, bounded-use boundary, and card boundary; C.2.1 claim identity and polarity; A.10 or B.3 for reliance.
* **Coordinates with:** F.18 and F.5 for designators; A.6.6 for identifiers; C.2.1 for effective reference scheme, episteme edition, and empirical grounding; A.2.6 for scope operations; A.15.6/A.15.1 for exact composite project Work; the patterns that define the temporal and direct predicates for their qualification windows; E.17.0 for viewpoint conformance and View membership; E.24.PUB for publication occurrence, form, and carrier; C.29 for mathematical representation; A.6.3.RT for the ordinary same-concern representation note, triggered exact construction, and occurrence only when actual Work is current; C.3.3 for the exact cross-local `KindBridge` and C.3.2 for the fresh target judgment; A.1.1/A.22 and the pattern that defines each selected structure crossing; A.2.8.PER for the exact permission result and any direct pattern needed for a separate authority relation.
* **Constrains:** every proposed use of an obtaining Bridge to cite an obtaining Bridge, state a separate C.2.1 claim for its exact direction, rule, tolerance, and polarity, recover current reliance when someone will rely on that claim, and state any claim about the actual receiving object using the rule that defines its predicate.
