## A.6.RSIG - Recognition Signatures for Descriptions

> **Type:** Architectural pattern
> **Status:** Stable
> **Normativity:** Normative unless marked informative

### A.6.RSIG:1 - Problem frame

A reader often meets one description before they know whether it is the right
description to inspect. The reader may see a boundary clause, method note,
interface excerpt, pattern opening, or public projection. The reader first needs
to recognize the description before reconstructing its full semantics:
what description is seen, where it is encountered, what it applies to, what
excludes it, and which `definitionEpistemeRef` identifies its defining `U.Episteme`.
Reject a nearby reading or wrong defining `U.Episteme` only when the grounded-guard
condition in §4.1 holds.

**Plain recognition line.** Find the defining `U.Episteme` for the encountered description.

Use this pattern while the reader needs to decide whether one encountered
description is the right description to inspect, before broader comparison,
publication-face selection, boundary-claim routing, or pattern-language entry
comparison begins.

What goes wrong if this pattern is missed:

- one summary, excerpt, boundary phrase, or local top is mistaken for the
  defining `U.Episteme` of the description;
- one access/request description is over-read as a promise about downstream
  effect;
- one boundary-presented description is over-read as L/A/D/E-classified claim structure or
  as the full semantic claim set;
- one method note is treated as applicable before its actual method family and
  exclusions are recoverable;
- one pattern-local opening is forced to carry cross-pattern comparison that
  belongs to `E.11`.

What this pattern buys:

- the reader can tell what the encountered description is for before deeper
  semantics are reconstructed;
- carrier, projection, description, and defining `U.Episteme` stay distinct;
- false neighboring descriptions and wrong defining `U.Episteme` references become
  rejectable in one first pass;
- later boundary, publication, lexical, or pattern-language repairs start
  from first-contact identification instead of from guesswork.

Ordinary not-this-pattern boundary:

- not when the reader's question already concerns full routed-claim structure, published
  view law, lexical repair, or cross-pattern entry orientation;
- not when the real question is the whole semantics of the method, boundary
  claim, interface promise, or pattern;
- not when a search/query phrase needs naming repair rather than
  first-contact recognition of a particular encountered description.

### A.6.RSIG:2 - Problem

When first-contact recognition is under-governed, several defects recur:

1. One reader finds a boundary, method, interface, or pattern-local opening but
   cannot tell whether it is the right description to inspect.
2. An encountered carrier or public projection is misread as the defining `U.Episteme`.
3. Recognition cues drift into description semantics, workflow hints, graph
   metaphors, or lexical aliases that belong elsewhere.
4. Pattern-entry navigation is asked to identify the encountered description
   before the reader can begin pattern-language comparison.

### A.6.RSIG:3 - Forces

| Force | Tension |
| --- | --- |
| First-contact precision vs reader economy | The cue needs enough discriminating detail without turning every opening into a mini essay. |
| Neutral substrate vs local specialization | This pattern governs description-recognition signatures in general without absorbing pattern-entry discoverability, publication-face law, or boundary-claim routing. |
| Recognition vs semantics | The cue helps the reader recover the right description and defining `U.Episteme`, not silently redefine the description's full semantics. |
| Carrier/projection vs authority | An encountered carrier can help recognition without becoming the defining episteme. |
| Local wording vs controlled lexemes | Real reader language remains usable without minting uncontrolled aliases or shadow names. |
| Readability vs auditability | The signature stays usable by readers while remaining crisp enough for later review and boundary checking. |

### A.6.RSIG:4 - Solution

#### A.6.RSIG:4.1 - Recognition-cue discipline and non-goals

`A.6.RSIG` governs description-recognition signatures in general: the
first-contact cue structure by which one reader can recover what encountered
description is live, what carrier or projection exposed it, what it applies to,
what excludes it, and which `definitionEpistemeRef` identifies its defining `U.Episteme`.
Reject a nearby reading or wrong defining `U.Episteme` only when it passes F.19's
grounded-guard test: the rejected reading has an independent local ground, is
plausible for the intended reader, and changes truth, understanding, selection,
safety, stop, reliance, or action. Use the
smallest clear correction; do not invent an alternative to fill the cue shape.

Here "description-recognition signature" is a lower-case authoring and reading
discipline, not by itself a typed `U.Signature` or a new formal kind. A typed
declaration requires the applicable neighboring pattern's explicit conditions.

The encountered carrier or projection may help recognition; it does not become
authoritative merely by being encountered.

Use `definitionEpistemeRef` for the defining `U.Episteme`. If the definition is available only through one publication, cite separately the exact E.24.PUB publication occurrence that makes it available; the publication, projection, or carrier does not become the defining episteme merely because it exposed the definition to the reader.

`A.6.RSIG` does not govern:

- general information architecture or search UX;
- documentation layout or publication-face selection;
- pattern-entry discoverability across a pattern language;
- the full semantics of the description itself;
- lexical repair, alias acceptance, or naming governance as such;
- graph ontology, workflow sequencing, or runtime route semantics.

#### A.6.RSIG:4.2 - Two-level description-recognition shape

**Reader-visible minimum.** For ordinary reader-facing use, the minimum is not a card. One or two
sentences may be enough if they make recoverable:

1. what this description is for;
2. when it applies;
3. when it does not apply;
4. which definitionEpistemeRef applies;
5. what nearby false reading or wrong defining `U.Episteme` to reject, when
   the grounded-guard condition in §4.1 holds.

**Review-expanded shape, only when needed.** When a recognition cue affects a
decision or is being reviewed, use the expanded recoverability shape:

```text
description_seen
encountered_carrier_or_projection
reader_viewpoint
case_signal_or_access_condition
applies_to
excludes
expected_first_recognition_gain
first_admissible_entry_stop_or_reroute
definitionEpistemeRef
projection_role_if_any
nearby_false_description_or_wrong_definition_episteme
```

The `nearby_false_description_or_wrong_definition_episteme` field is optional:
use it only when the grounded-guard condition in §4.1 holds.

This shape is a review aid, not a mandatory form for every encountered
description. It exists to keep description, carrier, projection, and definitionEpistemeRef from
collapsing into one overloaded publication label or projection label.

#### A.6.RSIG:4.2.1 - Minimal local repair and review sequence

Use this sequence when authoring or reviewing one recognition-signature repair:

1. Name the `description_seen` and the reader viewpoint in one concrete first
   sentence.
2. Name the encountered carrier or projection if confusing it with authority is
   a live risk.
3. State what the description applies to and what excludes it.
4. Name the defining `U.Episteme` to inspect first.
5. When the grounded-guard condition in §4.1 holds, name the nearby false
   description or wrong defining `U.Episteme` to reject.
6. State the first admissible entry stop or neighboring-pattern application.
7. If that stop cannot be stated without A.6.B claim routing, publication-face law,
   lexical repair, or cross-pattern comparison, apply the appropriate neighboring pattern instead of
   stretching `A.6.RSIG`.

Minimal admissible output:

- one first-contact recognition statement the reader can use immediately;
- one explicit defining `U.Episteme`;
- an explicit false-neighbor rejection when the grounded-guard condition in §4.1 holds;
- one admissible entry stop or reroute.

#### A.6.RSIG:4.3 - Parent cases

`A.6.RSIG` keeps the main parent cases explicit:

- **boundary-description recognition**: can one reader recover what one
  boundary-presented description is for before the reader needs to classify its
  claims as L/A/D/E;
- **method-description applicability recognition**: can one reader recover
  whether one method description is the right description to inspect, reject, or
  compare for the reader's question;
- **interface/access-description recognition**: can one reader recover the
  right access or interface description without confusing it with promise,
  execution, or downstream effect semantics;
- **pattern-local recognition-signature case**: can one reader recover one
  pattern opening as the right first description to inspect before broader
  pattern-language comparison begins.

#### A.6.RSIG:4.4 - Neighbor boundaries

Neighbor boundaries remain explicit:

- use `A.6.B` when the reader needs to classify the boundary claims as `L/A/D/E`;
- `E.17.0` tests viewpoint/view membership; `E.17` publishes reader-facing forms of an already accepted engineering account;
  use `E.24.PUB` when publication occurrence, form, or carrier identity affects the recognition use;
- `E.10.D2` recovers description-episteme and specification-use distinctions;
  use `E.10` cues within `F.19` for wording, `A.6.P` for under-specified direct relations, and `F.18` for durable naming and its collision checks;
- `C.16.Q` repairs overloaded recognition or discoverability quality wording;
  `C.25` applies when the quality-family claim depends on several differently typed contributors; a single-Characteristic claim stays with its direct Characteristic pattern;
- the relevant authoritative pattern body governs pattern semantics when the
  encountered description is one pattern-local opening.

The four-part split for pattern-local recognition is:

| Recognition concern | Governing FPF pattern or source | What it governs |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Generic first-contact description recognition | `A.6.RSIG` | The neutral cue shape: description, carrier or projection, definitionEpistemeRef, exclusions, and a false neighbor when §4.1's grounded-guard condition holds. |
| Local placement and form | `E.8` | How the pattern's `Problem frame` carries the first-reading role. |
| Actual local semantics | The pattern itself | The pattern's governed object, solution, consequences, and conformance law. |
| Cross-pattern comparison | `E.11` and `I.2` | Candidate patterns, tempting wrong patterns, reclassification of the reader's question, and expanded entry-disambiguation cases. |

#### A.6.RSIG:4.5 - When a neighboring pattern is needed

If the task requires a quality claim, typed signature declaration, reusable
description, or publication-face rule, use the neighboring pattern that governs
that object or claim, including its evidence requirements. The recognition cue
alone does not establish that result.

### A.6.RSIG:5 - Archetypal grounding

#### A.6.RSIG:5.1 - System-side worked recognition repair: boundary-presented description

Draft cue:

> "The system shall reject invalid requests."

Why the cue is not enough yet:

- the reader cannot tell whether they are reading one
  law, admissibility gate, duty, work effect, or evidence statement;
- one summary page or local paraphrase can be mistaken for the governing
  boundary description;
- a reviewer can start arguing full semantics before identifying which
  description to inspect.

Recognition repair:

1. `description_seen` = one boundary-presented admissibility description.
2. `encountered_carrier_or_projection` = one clause or excerpt where the
   description is seen.
3. `reader_viewpoint` = the perspective of a practitioner or reviewer deciding whether this is
   the right boundary description to inspect first.
4. `applies_to` = requests presented at the boundary under the declared
   admissibility conditions.
5. `excludes` = downstream effect claims, duty allocation, or evidence claims
   not actually stated by this description.
6. `definitionEpistemeRef` = the governing boundary description, not one local
   paraphrase or summary note.
7. `nearby_false_description_or_wrong_definition_episteme` = an evidence/work claim or
   a different routed-quadrant statement mistaken for the governing admissibility
   description.
8. `first_admissible_entry_stop_or_reroute` = the reader can now say "this is the
   admissibility description to inspect first"; if the reader needs to classify
   the boundary claims, inspect `A.6.B`.

#### A.6.RSIG:5.2 - System-side anti-case: interface/access description over-read as promise

Draft cue:

> "`POST /deploy` triggers deployment."

Plausible but wrong first reading:

- the reader treats deployment initiation as a guarantee of successful
  completion or of the whole deployment result.

Recognition repair:

1. `description_seen` = one interface/access description.
2. `encountered_carrier_or_projection` = one API excerpt or endpoint note.
3. `applies_to` = request accessibility, invocation form, and the stated
   deployment initiation under the conditions in the defining description.
4. `excludes` = success, completion, rollout, or downstream effect guarantees
   not present in the access description itself.
5. `definitionEpistemeRef` = the defining episteme for the access description;
   inspect the specification or pattern governing downstream effect separately if that question is current.
6. `first_admissible_entry_stop_or_reroute` = "this is the access description to
   inspect first: it describes invocation of `POST /deploy` and deployment
   initiation, not guaranteed successful completion."

#### A.6.RSIG:5.3 - Episteme-side worked recognition repair: method-description applicability

Draft cue:

> "Use pairwise comparison."

Why the cue is not enough yet:

- the reader cannot tell whether the note applies to ranking alternatives,
  selecting one option, shaping a shortlist, or comparing method families;
- the method note can be mistaken for the defining `U.Episteme` of selection
  semantics;
- a team can prematurely choose `C.11` or `G.5` before identifying what the
  pairwise comparison is to determine.

Recognition repair:

1. `description_seen` = one method-description applicability note.
2. `encountered_carrier_or_projection` = one method-description note, pattern excerpt,
   or review comment that mentions pairwise comparison.
3. `applies_to` = comparison under a declared comparator set or characteristic
   family.
4. `excludes` = publication of a selected set, execution planning, evidence
   sufficiency, and one-off decision doctrine. If one of those questions is
   current, apply the pattern that governs it and obtain the result it requires.
5. `definitionEpistemeRef` = the relevant comparison or method pattern, not the
   note itself.
6. `nearby_false_description_or_wrong_definition_episteme` = selection/publication doctrine
   treated as if the method note had already settled it.
7. `first_admissible_entry_stop_or_reroute` = method applicability is recognized or
   rejected before selection semantics begin.

### A.6.RSIG:6 - Bias-Annotation

This pattern counters:

- front-door centralization bias, where every description-recognition question
  is pushed into one global front-door cue;
- signature-stack overreach, where any useful cue is prematurely promoted into
  `U.Signature`;
- carrier-authority collapse, where an encountered carrier or projection is
  treated as the defining `U.Episteme`;
- alias bias, where uncontrolled synonyms compensate for missing recognition
  structure;
- workflow bias, where first-contact recognition is narrated as sequence or
  handoff.

### A.6.RSIG:7 - Conformance checklist

- **CC-RSIG-1 First-contact only.** The pattern governs recognition of the
  right description, not the full semantics of that description.
- **CC-RSIG-2 Carrier/definition-episteme split.** A conforming description-recognition signature
  distinguishes `description_seen`, encountered carrier or projection,
  defining `U.Episteme`, and projection role when those distinctions are
  load-bearing. The encountered carrier or projection may help recognition,
  but it does not become authoritative merely by being encountered.
- **CC-RSIG-3 Neighbor boundaries explicit.** The text states the conditions
  under which the recognition question calls for each relevant neighboring
  pattern in §4.4; use only the patterns that govern the current questions.
- **CC-RSIG-4 No kind inflation.** An ordinary recognition cue is not by itself a
  typed `U.Signature`; a task requiring a typed declaration uses the applicable
  neighboring pattern under §4.5.
- **CC-RSIG-5 Recoverable cue shape.** For load-bearing cases, description,
  viewpoint, cue, applicability, exclusion, defining `U.Episteme`, and admissible
  entry stop remain recoverable. A false neighbor is required only when the
  grounded-guard condition in §4.1 holds.
- **CC-RSIG-6 No alias minting.** Query cues and ordinary phrasing do not by
  themselves establish a naming settlement or Bridge. Use `F.18` for naming
  settlement and `F.9` for a Bridge, each under its own conditions.

### A.6.RSIG:8 - Common Anti-Patterns and How to Avoid Them

- **Recognition-as-semantics.** The opening tries to define the whole
  description instead of making the right description recoverable. Repair by
  shrinking back to first-contact discrimination.
- **Carrier-as-authority.** A local excerpt, public projection, or retrieved
  fragment is treated as the defining `U.Episteme`. Repair by naming the
  encountered carrier or projection and the defining `U.Episteme` separately.
- **Boundary-routing collapse.** A boundary-description cue tries to absorb
  L/A/D/E-classified claim structure. Repair by classifying the boundary claims under `A.6.B`.
- **Pattern-language collapse.** Pattern-entry comparison is written as if it
  were just another description cue. Repair by routing cross-pattern selection
  to `E.11`.
- **Signature inflation.** Any recurring cue is treated as one typed signature
  object. Repair by keeping `description-recognition signature` lower-case
  unless one explicit promotion is justified.

### A.6.RSIG:9 - Consequences

This pattern gives one neutral governing discipline for first-contact
description recognition without turning discoverability into one universal
governing pattern. It sharpens the boundary between cue recognition, semantic
authority, lexical repair, publication-face projection, and pattern-language
entry.

The cost is one extra explicit split when a cue is confusing: description,
encountered carrier or projection, and defining `U.Episteme` must not be
collapsed; include the false neighbor when §4.1's grounded-guard condition holds. The cost stays bounded because the expanded shape is review-only
or risk-triggered, not a required card for ordinary prose.

### A.6.RSIG:10 - Rationale


`A.6.RSIG` combines information-scent, human/AI expectation-management,
controlled vocabulary, and retrieval-context practices into one
description-facing discipline.

### A.6.RSIG:11 - SoTA-Echoing

This pattern is an `FPF`-local synthesis, not an established external term. It
carries the modern practice concern only where that concern sharpens one
description-facing recognition question: can the reader recover the right
description, its carrier or projection, its exclusions, its defining `U.Episteme`,
and, when §4.1's grounded-guard condition holds, its false neighbor before
relation precision or epistemic precision-restoration work begins?

| Pattern claim carried here | Source-bearing SoTA support (post-2015) | Alignment with `A.6.RSIG` | Adoption status and worked-slice implication |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| First-contact recognition is narrower than general information architecture or documentation UX. | Jorge Arango (2018), *Living in Information: Responsible Design for Digital Places*; ISO/IEC/IEEE 26514:2022, *Systems and software engineering - Design and development of information for users*. | These sources support purposeful information places and user information shaped around what the user needs. `A.6.RSIG` narrows that to one encountered description: what it is for, what applies, what excludes, what carrier exposed it, and which `definitionEpistemeRef` identifies the defining episteme. | **Adopt or narrow.** Adopt the recognition and information-need concern; reject a universal UX or layout pattern. In the boundary sentence slice, the first repair is not "what does the complete Contract Bundle mean?" but "what description is this, what does it apply to, and which definitionEpistemeRef applies?" |
| Information scent helps first-contact cue economy but is not the defining episteme. | Raluca Budiu (2020), "Information Scent: How Users Decide Where to Go Next", Nielsen Norman Group. | Information scent treats visible labels, context, and prior knowledge as imperfect estimates of source value. `A.6.RSIG` adopts the cue-economy insight and adds definition-episteme and exclusion discipline, with false-neighbor rejection under §4.1's grounded-guard condition. | **Adopt and add definition-episteme discipline.** Adopt first-contact cue economy; reject treating familiar wording, link scent, or local projection as the defining `U.Episteme`. In the API slice, an endpoint label can attract attention and state deployment initiation without promising successful completion. |
| Description-recognition signatures help human and AI-assisted readers manage applicability and limitation expectations. | Amershi et al. (2019), "Guidelines for Human-AI Interaction", CHI 2019. | Human-AI guidance emphasizes making capabilities and limits clear enough for users to calibrate trust. `A.6.RSIG` adapts that pressure into `applies_to`, `excludes`, `definitionEpistemeRef`, and admissible entry stop for human and AI-assisted readers. | **Adapt.** Adopt expectation management; reject making this an AI-interface pattern. In the method-note slice, the reader learns what the note can and cannot settle before using it for a decision. |
| Description-recognition cues need controlled wording without becoming synonym or alias governance. | Helen Lippell, ed. (2022), *Taxonomies: Practical Approaches to Developing and Managing Vocabularies for Digital Information*. | Taxonomy practice supports governed terms, validation, and maintenance for search and browse. `A.6.RSIG` adopts stable cue language while leaving wording repair to `E.10` cues within `F.19`, durable naming, aliases, and collision checks to `F.18`, actual Bridge claims to `F.9`, and under-specified relation claims to `A.6.P`. | **Adapt.** Adopt controlled-lexeme discipline; reject synonym stuffing inside description-recognition signatures. The worked slices state definitionEpistemeRef, exclusions, and a false neighbor when §4.1's grounded-guard condition holds, instead of adding more query phrases. |
| Thin echoes and projection snippets need definition-episteme anchors before a reader or retrieval system treats them as the defining episteme. | Lewis et al. (2020), "Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Knowledge-Intensive NLP Tasks"; Liu, Zhang, and Liang (2023), "Evaluating Verifiability in Generative Search Engines"; Gao et al. (2023), "Enabling Large Language Models to Generate Text with Citations". | Retrieval and citation work makes source context, support, and verifiability load-bearing. Before relying on a retrieved fragment, public projection, or local example to identify a particular defining description, recover the defining `U.Episteme` and the projection relation when relevant. An unresolved fragment may still guide further inspection. | **Adapt / narrow.** Adopt source anchoring and citation-support pressure; reject a retrieval benchmark or graph-native authority. A retrieved applicability cue does not by itself settle selection semantics. |
| Description-recognition-signature adequacy is reviewable through small, case-linked checks. | Riehle, Harutyunyan, and Barcomb (2020), *Pattern Discovery and Validation Using Scientific Research Methods*, Technical Report CS-2020-01. | Pattern-validation practice supports explicit evidence and case adequacy. `A.6.RSIG` keeps that pressure lightweight: use the first-contact shape, false-neighbor rejection when §4.1's grounded-guard condition holds, and worked slices first; add `C.25` only for a composite quality-family claim, `C.16.Q` only for overloaded evaluative wording, and empirical evidence when the recognition claim requires it. | **Adopt / lightweight.** Adopt accountable validation; reject mandatory benchmark machinery for ordinary recognition repairs. |

### A.6.RSIG:12 - Relations

- **Builds on:** `A.6`, `A.6.P`, `F.18`, `E.10`
- **Does not specialise:** `A.6.0` / `U.Signature`; it uses "signature" only in the lower-case cue-pattern sense unless an explicit neighbouring pattern promotes the structure into a typed declaration.
- **Neighbors:** `A.6.B`, `A.6.C`, `E.17.0`, `E.17`, `E.10.D2`, `C.25`, `C.16.Q`
- **Supports:** `E.11` as the pattern-language application above this neutral substrate
