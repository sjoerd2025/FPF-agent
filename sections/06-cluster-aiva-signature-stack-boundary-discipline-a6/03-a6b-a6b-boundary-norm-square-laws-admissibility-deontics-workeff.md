## A.6.B — Boundary Norm Square (Laws / Admissibility / Deontics / Work‑Effects)

> **Type:** Architectural (A)
> **Status:** Stable
> **Normativity:** Normative (unless explicitly marked informative)
> **Placement:** Part A → A.6.B (matrix module; referenced by A.6 cluster overview)
> **Builds on:** E.8 (authoring template), A.6.0 (`U.Signature`), A.6.1 (`U.Mechanism`), A.6.3 (`U.EpistemicViewing`), E.17.0/E.17 (MVPK + “no new semantics” faces), A.7 (EntityOfConcern and Description-episteme boundary; specification-use and publication-carrier distinction), A.2.3 (promise content when contract language is current), A.2.8 (`U.Commitment`), A.2.8.PER (subject pattern selected by the permission-word branch), A.2.9 (`U.SpeechAct`), E.10.D2 (EntityOfConcern and Description-episteme boundary; specification-use and refinement discipline), E.10 publication face, form, unit, and carrier discipline
> **Purpose (one line):** Provide a canonical 2×2 norm square that classifies boundary statements (L/A/D/E), constrains how each quadrant is written, and defines explicit cross‑quadrant reference rules to support later boundary evolution and audit.

**Use this when.** Use `A.6.B` when boundary wording mixes definitions, runtime entry conditions, generic prescriptions, individual duties or grants, actual work or evaluation results, and evidence.

**First useful move.** Split the live passage into atomic claims, classify each claim by modality and adjudication position, and replace any consequential paraphrase dependency with an ID or canonical-location reference.

**What changes in practice.** Laws, gates, governance, and work-and-evidence claims can change without silently changing one another; publication faces reuse the canonical claims instead of restating them.

**Ordinary non-use boundary.** A one-off local sentence with one recoverable logical job still needs the correct quadrant, but it does not need a Claim Register or a separate publication form. Add those only when reuse, decision, audit, or cross-face citation needs them; §6.1 still requires any material dependency to name the claim by ID or canonical location.

### A.6.B:0 — Conventions

**Keywords.** The key words **MUST**, **MUST NOT**, **SHOULD**, **SHOULD NOT**, **MAY**, and **SHALL** are to be interpreted as in RFC 2119/8174. Lower-case `must`, `may`, and `should` in explanatory prose is descriptive, not normative.

**Quadrant labels.** This pattern uses the classification labels **L / A / D / E** as *statement quadrants*:

* **L** — Laws & Definitions
* **A** — Admissibility & Gates
* **D** — Deontics & Commitments
* **E** — Work‑Effects & Evidence

These labels are **claim-classification labels for statements**, not MVPK face designators and not pattern identifiers.

**Statement identifiers (recommended).** Classifiable statements **SHOULD** be given stable IDs with a quadrant prefix: `L-*`, `A-*`, `D-*`, `E-*`. Other sections and views **SHOULD** reference these IDs or the canonical claim locations rather than restating the same constraint in new words.

**Non-collision note (informative).** The `A-*` prefix here is “Admissibility”, not Part-A numbering and not MVPK’s `AssuranceLane` face designator. If this is a readability hazard in your program, prefer an explicit `G-*` (“Gate”) local convention while keeping the quadrant name “Admissibility”. Also avoid introducing single-letter mnemonics for MVPK face designators inside this cluster; spell face designators in full to reduce collisions.

**Atomic claim.** An **atomic claim** is a sentence (or bullet) that performs exactly one logical role and is classifiable under exactly one quadrant. If a sentence mixes roles, it is **not atomic** and **MUST** be split before it can be classified.

**Adjudication substrate (for classification).** For the purposes of this square, an atomic claim is classified by where its own truth condition or governance content is settled. This tells you how to classify the sentence; it does not make an individual commitment, grant, or finding exist.

* **In-description or in-theory**: an `L-*` truth condition is settled by inspecting, proving, or type-validating the description; a generic `D-*` claim states exact normative content, while an individual `D-*` claim names the commitment or grant it concerns.
* **In-work or in-execution**: deciding satisfaction requires observing executed work, inspecting carriers produced in work, or both.

**Note (important).** Writing a `D-*` claim records either generic normative content or a claim about an individual duty, commitment, or grant; it does not institute an individual relation or establish compliance. When the wording is about permission, use the permission-word branch in §8.4.1 to recover the exact object, what makes it obtain, and the evidence needed before reliance.

**Modality family.** A claim is either:

* **Truth‑conditional**: definitions, invariants, typing rules (“is”, “iff”, “∀”).
* **Governance**: prescriptions, individual obligations or commitments, grants, and exclusions (the RFC keywords `MUST`, `SHOULD`, and `MAY`, “is admissible”, “is blocked”, “commits to”).

### A.6.B:1 — Problem frame

Boundary descriptions routinely collapse four distinct claim families into “contract soup”: definitions are written as obligations, runtime gates are hidden inside laws, governance talk is assigned to “the interface”, and operational-result “guarantees” are asserted without the actual Work, evaluation, or observation needed to settle them. The resulting boundary is brittle: substitution becomes unclear, and auditability becomes performative rather than adjudicable.

FPF already separates the necessary strata (Signature vs Mechanism, EntityOfConcern, Description episteme, and carrier, views under viewpoints). What is still needed is a **single, reusable classification primitive** that any boundary text can apply consistently and that other patterns can cite as a stable authoring module.

### A.6.B:2 — Problem

When authors cannot reliably answer two questions—

1. “Is this a truth‑conditional statement or a governance statement?”
2. “Is it adjudicated by reading the description or by observing work?”

—then boundary statements drift across layers, faces fork semantics, and “compliance” becomes a matter of interpretation rather than a property that can be checked.

A boundary needs a minimal, stable classification that:

* classifies every **atomic** statement into a unique quadrant, and
* forces any cross‑quadrant dependencies to be **explicitly referenced**, not smuggled by paraphrase.

### A.6.B:3 — Forces

| Force                              | Tension                                                                                        |
| ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Precision vs readability**       | Predicate‑style constraints reduce ambiguity; narrative helps adoption.                        |
| **Evolvability vs enforceability** | Stable laws should not embed volatile runtime gates; governance still needs enforcement hooks. |
| **Auditability vs simplicity**     | Evidence makes claims adjudicable; evidence also introduces operational design obligations.    |
| **Local meaning vs reuse**         | Boundaries must be local; reuse must be explicit via IDs and references, not duplicated prose. |

### A.6.B:4 - Solution — the Boundary Norm Square

#### A.6.B:4.1 - Two independent distinctions

The **Boundary Norm Square** is the cross product of two independent distinctions:

1. **Modality family:** Truth‑conditional vs Governance
2. **Adjudication position:** In-description vs in-work

The square yields four quadrants that are *mutually exclusive for atomic claims*.

#### A.6.B:4.2 — The square

|                                | **Truth‑conditional** (definitions & invariants) | **Governance** (governance conditions & obligations) |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| **In-description or in-theory** | **L — Laws & Definitions**                       | **D — Deontics & Commitments**             |
| **In-work or in-execution**     | **E — Work‑Effects & Evidence**                  | **A — Admissibility & Gates**              |

**Clarification (classify the claim by its job, not by its subject pattern).**

* Classify the exact atomic claim by what its sentence states and by the conditions that let a reader decide it.
* The exact ClaimGraph located through the subject pattern supplies the referenced object's predicate and obtaining conditions; it does not choose the claim's quadrant.
* When permission wording is present, use the single permission-word branch in §8.4.1. It separates the possible jobs of that wording without inventing a common “permission result” kind.

**Normative rule (single quadrant).** Each **atomic** claim **MUST** be classifiable under exactly one quadrant **L/A/D/E**.

**Normative rule (no mixed sentences).** A conforming boundary text **SHALL** decompose any sentence that bundles multiple quadrants (typical form: “MUST … if … then … and it is logged …”) into multiple atomic claims before those claims are treated as normative.

#### A.6.B:4.3 — Canonical placements in the Signature Stack

The quadrants have canonical placements in the boundary stack:

* **L → Signature layer:** `U.Signature.Laws` (and mechanism‑local semantic laws if present).
* **A → Mechanism layer:** `U.Mechanism.AdmissibilityConditions` (entry gates / runtime admissibility predicates).
* **D → Deontics & Commitments layer:** atomic claims about a generic prescription or about one separately obtaining individual duty, recommendation-as-duty, prohibition, or commitment. When permission wording is live, §8.4.1 decides whether its claim also belongs here.
* **E → Work-Effects & Evidence layer:** truth-conditional claims whose satisfaction requires actual work, evaluation, observation, or produced carriers.

A publication face **MUST NOT** introduce new semantic claims outside this L/A/D/E-classified claim set. **E.17 (MVPK)** enforces this rule for publication faces and their selected profiles.

### A.6.B:5 — Quadrant specifications

This section is the normative “API” of the square: what each quadrant is for, how it is written, and what it must not contain.

#### A.6.B:5.1 — Quadrant L: Laws & Definitions

**Intent.** State truth‑conditional content: definitions, invariants, typing and well-formedness constraints, equational laws.

**Adjudication.** In‑description: can be checked by inspection, proof, type validation, or model reasoning.

**Canonical form.** `Definition:` / `Invariant:` / predicate‑style constraints using “is / iff / for all”.

**Prohibitions.**

* An `L-*` statement **MUST NOT** contain RFC deontic keywords (**MUST, SHALL, SHOULD, or MAY**) as operators inside the law or definition itself.
* An `L-*` statement **MUST NOT** encode runtime gate predicates (those are `A-*`).
* An `L-*` statement **MUST NOT** assert evidence availability or measurement outcomes (those are `E-*`).

**A.7 EntityOfConcern binding.** Identify what the `L-*` definition, invariant,
or typing rule concerns, separately from the episteme carrying the claim. Its
EntityOfConcern need not itself be a description and may be Work.

**Typical dependence.** `A-*` and `E-*` claims may reference `L-*` IDs or canonical locations for vocabulary, metric definitions, and invariants needed for interpretation.

#### A.6.B:5.2 — Quadrant A: Admissibility & Gates

**Intent.** Specify when a mechanism application is admissible: runtime entry predicates, validity gates, and applicability checks that require context or execution environment. An `A-*` predicate may consume a separately established result as one input, but it does not create or settle that result. If the sentence uses permission wording, choose its job with the branch in §8.4.1.

**Common mistake #0 — Applicability ≠ Admissibility (informative).** Signature `Applicability` scopes *intended use and bounded context*; it is not a runtime entry gate. Runtime entry checks and admissibility predicates belong in `U.Mechanism.AdmissibilityConditions` as `A-*`. If prose reads “clients must satisfy the applicability”, separate the `A-*` gate from either a generic `D-*` prescription or, when independently instituted, an individual duty linked to that gate.

**Adjudication.** In‑work: evaluated at mechanism entry (or operationally at the point the mechanism is applied).

**Canonical form.** Predicate style, e.g.:

* “A request is admissible iff …”
* `admissible(x) iff P(x)` (conceptual form; no particular syntax is required)

**Prohibitions.**

* An `A-*` statement **MUST NOT** be placed in `U.Signature.Laws`.
* An `A-*` statement **MUST NOT** use RFC deontic keywords as if it were an agent obligation. (It is a gate predicate, not a duty.)
* An `A-*` statement **MUST NOT** claim that evidence exists (that is `E-*`) or that someone must enforce the gate (that is `D-*`).

**A.7 EntityOfConcern binding.** An `A-*` claim concerns the mechanism-entry
predicate: what the mechanism admits, not a client's duty to comply with it.
Keep that predicate distinct from the episteme carrying the claim.

**Required references (explicit).** If an `A-*` predicate relies on defined terms or invariants, it **SHOULD** reference the relevant `L-*` IDs or canonical locations (or at minimum the signature that defines them).

#### A.6.B:5.3 — Quadrant D: Deontics & Commitments

**Intent.** State one atomic deontic claim. A generic prescription states what one exact policy or other normative episteme requires; it does not create an individual duty bearer or commitment occurrence. A claim that one actual System or separately governed party has that duty instead cites one separately obtaining A.2.8 `U.Commitment`. When a sentence sounds permissive, use §8.4.1; only its **Grant or norm** row enters D. Writing the `D-*` sentence neither institutes a relation nor establishes compliance.

**Adjudication.** For a generic prescription, inspect the exact normative source, its applicable rule content, scope, and current edition. For an individual duty, apply A.2.8 to the separately obtaining commitment and its actual basis. The wording itself decides neither obtaining nor compliance.

**Canonical form.** First choose the route. A generic D claim names the normative episteme and the rule content being stated, without inventing an individual bearer. An individual-duty D claim names the actual bearer and exact `U.Commitment`; a system-role kind or assignment may be a rule ground but is neither bearer nor duty. A responsibility claim uses an admitted domain responsibility predicate and its actual participants, or returns its exact missing governor. A permissive-looking word does not by itself select D; use §8.4.1 for the grant route. Examples:

* Generic: “`APIEntryPolicy-v4` requires covered clients to satisfy `A-…`.” No individual commitment is asserted.
* Individual: “Actual bearer `ClientIntegrator-A` has commitment `COM-17` to satisfy `A-…`.”

**Canonical assertion (recommended; lintable).** Use a `CommitmentAssertion` only when an individual-duty claim must be reused or audited. It concerns one exact separately obtaining `U.Commitment` and makes explicit:

* `entityOfConcernRef`, resolving to one exact `U.Commitment` occurrence, and the `D-*` claim ID;
* exactly one actual bearer branch: `dutyBearerSystemRef` or `dutyBearerPartyRef`;
* non-empty exact `dutyReferentRefs` and any actual counterparties;
* the A.2.8 `DeonticModalityToken`, scope, and validity window;
* the exact current constitutive policy, individualizing rule, and actual instituting basis required by that rule; and
* evidence-claim or carrier references only when the receiving reliance or adjudication needs them.

The assertion states and supports a claim about the relation. Its fields, publication, and evidence do not make the relation obtain.

**Prohibitions.**

* A generic `D-*` statement **MUST NOT** invent an individual bearer or commitment; name its exact normative source and rule content. An individual-duty `D-*` statement **MUST NOT** use “the system, service, interface, or specification” as a vague subject; name the actual duty-bearing system or separately governed party and exact `U.Commitment`, with an assignment only when the constitutive rule uses it as a ground. Use `A.6.C` when ambiguity in promise, utterance, approval, guarantee, or agreement-like boundary wording changes the claim's interpretation or use.
* A `D-*` statement **MUST NOT** restate `L-*` or `A-*` predicates in new words when an ID exists; it **SHOULD** reference the ID or canonical location.
* A `D-*` statement **MUST NOT** pretend that a duty, commitment, or grant is a law or that writing the claim makes it obtain.

**A.7 EntityOfConcern binding.** A generic `D-*` claim episteme concerns the exact normative rule content it states. An individual `D-*` claim concerns the exact duty, commitment, or grant named by its content and does not substitute for that object. When permission wording is live, the branch in §8.4.1 names the subject pattern and the obtaining or non-obtaining test.

**Required references (explicit).**

* If a `D-*` claim states a prescription or duty to comply with a gate, it **MUST** reference the relevant `A-*` ID(s) or canonical location(s).
* If a `D-*` statement is meant to be auditable, it **SHOULD** reference the `E-*` claim(s) that provide evidence and the carrier classes involved.

#### A.6.B:5.4 — Quadrant E: Work‑Effects & Evidence

**Intent.** State a truth-conditional result that can be settled only from actual work, evaluation, observation, or produced carriers.

**Adjudication.** In-work or by an exact evaluation of work and its conditions. Reading a subject-pattern description or seeing a record is not enough.

**Canonical form.** Write the ordinary result first, then make recoverable only what settles it:

1. the exact predicate and object that the claim concerns;
2. the participants, work or evaluation occurrence, scope/window, comparison frame, and other conditions required by that predicate; and
3. the evidence or source-use relation and its carrier only when a gate, plan, audit, or assurance decision relies on that support. A carrier may support the claim but does not create the work, effect, or finding.

When permission wording is current, use the branch in §8.4.1 for the exact occurrence or finding, its failure test, predicate, and subject-pattern locator; do not repeat that subject-question catalogue here.

**Prohibitions.**

* `E-*` statements **SHOULD NOT** use RFC deontic keywords; they report adjudicable results rather than obligations.
* An `E-*` statement **MUST NOT** hide a gate predicate; gate predicates are `A-*`.
* An `E-*` statement **MUST NOT** assign agency to an interface, record, or publication. For any precise cited Work, first recover each exact actual performer through A.13 and let A.15.1 independently admit the dated Work. Add an exact A.2.1 assignment reference and F.6 only when this claim or its receiving use expressly consumes precise assignment-bound attribution through the same obtaining A.13 assignment; F.6 identifies neither the assignment nor the performer, and missing or failed F.6 leaves the Work intact. If enforceability or commitment is intended, express a separate `D-*` claim.

**A.7 EntityOfConcern binding.** An `E-*` claim episteme concerns the exact work effect, evaluated finding, evidence relation, or carrier condition named by its predicate. A record or carrier is a separate object and becomes the concern only when its existence or condition is itself the claim.

**Required references (explicit).**

* If the result is conditioned on a gate decision, the `E-*` statement **SHOULD** reference the relevant `A-*` ID(s) or canonical location(s).
* If another object is needed to settle the predicate, reference that object's subject pattern without importing its quadrant.
* If evidence is used for reliance, cite the exact A.10 or G.6 evidence-use relation rather than treating carrier presence as truth.

### A.6.B:6 — Cross‑quadrant link discipline

The square is not just classification; it is a **dependency discipline**. Claims often depend on each other; such dependencies **MUST** be explicit (by claim ID or canonical location) rather than duplicated prose.

#### A.6.B:6.1 — Explicit reference rule

If a claim’s meaning materially depends on another L/A/D/E-classified claim, that dependency **MUST** be represented as an explicit reference to the other claim’s ID (or to the canonical location where it lives), rather than by restating it.

**Guideline (informative).** Treat this as “import hygiene” for prose: reuse by reference, not by copy.

#### A.6.B:6.2 — Canonical cross‑quadrant dependency patterns

These patterns are valid (and common). The square becomes operational when these links are used systematically.

##### A.6.B:6.2.1 - (D → A) Prescription-or-duty-to-gate linkage

When governance says that a gate must be satisfied or enforced:

* generic `D-*`: “`Policy-P` requires covered subjects to satisfy or enforce `A-*`”; or
* individual `D-*`: “Actual bearer `S` has commitment `C` to satisfy or enforce `A-*`.”

This separates **what is admissible** (A) from generic normative content and any separately instituted individual duty (D). If responsibility is also claimed, state its admitted direct domain predicate or exact missing governor rather than inferring it from the duty.

##### A.6.B:6.2.2 - (E → A) Evidence-for-gate linkage

When a claim reports actual observability of a gate decision:

* `E-*`: “For the stated rejection or acceptance due to `A-*`, carrier `C` was produced or observed under conditions …”

This separates **gate semantics** (A) from the **actual observation or result** (E).
A prescription to produce or retain a carrier belongs in D; an expectation or
plan alone supplies no actual E result.

##### A.6.B:6.2.3 - (D → E) Prescription-or-duty-to-evidence linkage

When governance prescribes evidence production, retention, exposure, or a
measured property and a separate `E-*` claim states the related result:

* generic `D-*`: “`Policy-P` requires covered subjects to retain or expose carrier class `C` used by `E-*` …”; or
* individual `D-*`: “Actual bearer `S` has commitment `CMT` to meet `E-*` under exclusions …”

This separates a **generic prescription or individual duty** (D) from its **adjudication** (E).

##### A.6.B:6.2.4 - (A/E → L) Semantic grounding linkage

When a gate predicate or measurement relies on definitions or invariants:

* `A-*` / `E-*` references `L-*` that define terms or metrics.

This prevents “metric drift” and “definition drift” across views.

##### A.6.B:6.2.5 - (D → L) Governance-to-definition linkage

When a generic prescription or individual obligation relies on precise term or metric meanings:

* `D-*` references `L-*` that define the terms or metrics it uses.

This keeps governance text from accidentally redefining semantics in prose.

#### A.6.B:6.3 — The “triangle decomposition” for mixed sentences

**Normative rule (decomposition).** A conforming boundary text **SHALL** decompose
any mixed sentence into its actual claim jobs. Recover the predicate and modality
of an observability clause before assigning its quadrant. The triangle applies
when the source states all three:

* **A:** admissibility predicate (`A-*`)
* **D:** generic prescription or individual-duty claim referencing the gate (`D-* → A-*`)
* **E:** actual observation or result referencing the gate, with carriers when needed (`E-* → A-*`)

Keep a prescription or individually instituted duty to produce evidence in D.
Preserve an expectation or plan as such; leave the actual E result absent until
its basis exists. This repairs mixed validity, authorization, compliance, audit,
and security claims without manufacturing a third claim.

#### A.6.B:6.4 — Dependency direction (no “upward” imports)

The square is intended to preserve **layered modularity**: semantics should not depend on governance text, and evidence semantics should not depend on duties.

These are cross-quadrant restrictions. They do not prohibit same-quadrant
references, such as `L-* → L-*` or `E-* → E-*`.

**Normative rule (no upward dependencies).**

* `L-*` claims **MUST NOT** depend on or reference `A-*`, `D-*`, or `E-*` claims (except for purely informative notes explicitly marked informative).
* `A-*` claims **MUST NOT** depend on or reference `D-*` claims. (`A-*` may reference `L-*` for defined terms or invariants.)
* `E-*` claims **MUST NOT** depend on or reference `D-*` claims. (`E-*` may reference `A-*` for conditioning and `L-*` for metric or term meanings.)
* `D-*` claims **MAY** reference `L-*`, `A-*`, and `E-*` claims when needed, and **SHOULD** do so by ID or canonical location rather than restating content.

**Rationale (informative).** This keeps foundational meaning stable (L), keeps runtime gates independent of governance prose (A), and keeps evidence semantics independent of enforcement policy (E). Governance (D) is the place where “who must do what, using which gates and which evidence” is assembled.

### A.6.B:7 — Mini-register: Claim Register (informative, recommended)

A Claim Register is a drift‑control device that lists every classifiable statement verbatim with classification metadata. It is not a new meaning authority.

| ID | Quadrant | Statement (verbatim) | Canonical location (section or publication unit) | Stack layer | A.7 primary layer | viewRef | viewpointRef | References | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

Guidance (informative):
* The **Statement** cell should contain the normative text as authored (copied by value), not a paraphrase.
* **Canonical location** should point to the one place the statement “lives” (e.g., `Signature.Laws`, `Mechanism.AdmissibilityConditions`, `TechCard.NormsCommitments`, `Evidence.Carriers`), so other faces can cite its ID or canonical location.
* **Stack layer** should be one of `{Signature, Mechanism, Norms-and-commitments, Evidence-and-carriers}` to make classification auditable.
* **A.7 primary layer** identifies the claim's EntityOfConcern, with its kind
  when needed. The concern may itself be a Description episteme or publication carrier;
  it remains distinct from the episteme carrying the claim.
* **viewRef** and **viewpointRef** are used when the corresponding view or viewpoint identity matters under E.17; `U.View` membership requires E.17.0 conformance.
* Use **References** for explicit cross‑quadrant links: for example, which `D-*`
  states a requirement or individual duty to enforce which `A-*` predicate, which
  `E-*` reports the result or evidence used to adjudicate which commitment, and
  which `L-*` defines a metric used by `E-*`. Add external standards or policies
  where applicable.

### A.6.B:8 - Archetypal Grounding (Tell–Show–Show)

> **Informative.** Examples for learning the square; they do not add requirements beyond A.6.B:10.

#### A.6.B:8.1 - Tell (universal rule)

Decomposing every normative statement into atomic claims, classifying each under
exactly one quadrant of the Boundary Norm Square, and expressing cross‑quadrant
dependencies by claim ID or canonical location rather than paraphrase supports
later boundary evolution and audit.

#### A.6.B:8.2 - Show #1: Effect signature vs handler (post‑2015 effect systems)

A service boundary naturally mirrors **algebraic effects & handlers** practice (popularized broadly in the post‑2015 era, with mainstream effect handlers becoming especially prominent around OCaml 5):

* **L:** defines the operation vocabulary and laws (effect signature semantics).
* **A:** defines when the operation is admissible (runtime guard predicates).
* **D:** states who must enforce guards and what the provider commits to (operator and implementer duties; SLAs).
* **E:** ties “what happened” to observable carriers (traces, logs, metrics, and events) so commitments can be adjudicated.

The square prevents accidentally writing handler obligations as laws or treating observability as a definition.

#### A.6.B:8.3 - Show #2: ML evaluation protocol boundary (reproducibility discipline)

A published “evaluation protocol” boundary (common in modern ML governance) benefits from strict classification:

* **L:** metric definitions and invariants (e.g., what counts as AUROC; data partition invariants).
* **A:** admissibility gates (dataset usage-term constraints; pinned environment constraints; seed policy).
* **D:** checker and author duties (publish required faces; use declared dataset version; retention duties for run evidence carriers).
* **E:** admitted system `EvaluationRunner-A` performed `MLProtocolEvaluation-T1 : U.Work` over `Model-M1`, `Dataset-D7`, the pinned environment and seed policy, and evaluation window `T`; the exact AUROC metric application declared by the L claim returned `AUROCResult-T1` with `measuredAUROC=0.91`. When a checker, gate, or audit decision relies on that result, an A.10 evidence-provenance path links it to exact carriers `RunLog-T1`, `DatasetHash-D7`, `EvaluationReport-R1`, and `TraceSet-T1`.

The square keeps “must use dataset vX” (D) separate from “evaluation is admissible iff dataset usage terms match” (A), and both separate from “`MLProtocolEvaluation-T1` returned `AUROCResult-T1(measuredAUROC=0.91)`” (E). The report and log carriers may support reliance on that result; producing a carrier is not the measured result.

#### A.6.B:8.4 — Worked Rewrite Kit (informative, recommended)

> **Informative.** This kit is a worked, copy‑pasteable restatement of A.6.B’s rules (atomicity, L/A/D/E classification, explicit references, triangle decomposition, and no‑upward dependencies). If anything here conflicts with A.6.B, **A.6.B is authoritative**.

##### A.6.B:8.4.0 - Goal

Convert a boundary-ish sentence that mixes “laws / gates / duties / evidence” into:

1. **atomic L/A/D/E-classified claims** (L/A/D/E),
2. **explicit references by claim ID or canonical location** (no paraphrase duplication),
3. **a readable recomposition** (separate Tech and Plain forms when their readers need them),
4. **a minimal anti-pattern lint** (things we reject / flag).

##### A.6.B:8.4.1 - Micro-procedure (Atomize → Classify → Triangle → Link → Bind References → Recompose)

**Step 1 — Atomize.** Split mixed prose into atomic claims; each must classify to exactly one quadrant.

**Step 2 — Classify (L/A/D/E).**

* **L** if the claim is **truth‑conditional** and adjudicable *in‑description* (inspection, proof or type validation, or model reasoning **over declared assumptions**): definitions, invariants, typing and well-formedness constraints.
  **Guardrails:** `L-*` MUST NOT (i) use RFC deontic keywords as operators, (ii) encode runtime entry predicates (those are `A-*`), or (iii) assert evidence existence or measurement outcomes (those are `E-*`).
* **A** if it is an *in‑work* **gate predicate**: what the mechanism admits at application time (“admissible iff …”). It is not a duty and MUST NOT be phrased as one.
  **Guardrails:** `A-*` SHOULD be written in predicate form and MUST NOT (i) use RFC deontic keywords as if it were an agent obligation, (ii) claim that evidence carriers exist (that is `E-*`), or (iii) assign responsibility or enforcement (that is `D-*`).
  *(Do not confuse this with `Signature.Applicability`: applicability scopes intended meaning and intended use; it is not a runtime entry gate.)*
* **D** if the exact atomic statement states either a generic prescription or an individual duty, recommendation-as-duty, prohibition, or commitment. A permissive sentence enters D only through the **Grant or norm** row below.
  **Guardrails:** a generic claim names the exact normative episteme and applicable rule content without inventing an individual relation. An individual-duty claim names its actual bearer and exact separately obtaining A.2.8 commitment. A grant claim instead follows the participant and ground test in the **Grant or norm** row. A system-role kind or assignment may be a rule ground but is neither bearer nor deontic relation. Writing any claim does not make its object obtain.
* **E** if it is an *in-work* truth-conditional claim whose satisfaction requires actual work, evaluation, observation, or produced carriers.
  **Predicate-specific minimum:** name the exact `E-*` predicate and object, then the actual work, evaluation, or observation, scope/window, comparison frame, and other settling conditions that this predicate needs. Add an evidence or source-use relation, carrier/schema, viewpoint, or consumer only when the receiving gate, plan, audit, assurance, or other reliance decision depends on that support.
  **Guardrails:** `E-*` SHOULD NOT use RFC deontic keywords, MUST NOT hide a gate predicate (that is `A-*`), and MUST NOT cite `D-*`.
  *(If the source sentence is “Role SHALL measure, retain, or expose …”, first decide whether it is a generic prescription about an exact system-role kind or a claim about one actual bearer. Classify either as **D**, but assert an individual commitment only on the second route.)*

**Step 3 — Triangle decomposition.** Recover the observability clause's predicate
and modality under §6.3. Use the A/D/E triangle only when the source states an
entry condition, a generic prescription or individual duty, and an actual
observation or result:

* **A**: the admissibility predicate (what must be true to treat the claim as applicable),
* **D → A**: which exact policy prescribes keeping or enforcing the predicate, or which actual bearer has that separately instituted duty; any responsibility relation is stated separately under its direct domain predicate
* **E → A**: the actual observation or result and, when needed, the evidence or
  traces used to adjudicate the predicate.

A requirement to produce or retain evidence stays in D. Preserve an expectation
or plan without inventing an actual E result.

**Permission-word branch (use only when the sentence sounds permissive).** Choose the row by the job the sentence performs, not by the word *may*, *approved*, *authorized*, or *permitted*.

| Branch | Ask this plain question | Square result | Subject pattern and what closes the row |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Grant or norm** | Does the sentence state a generic prescription, claim that one actual bearer has an individual duty, or tell a named beneficiary which action is permitted and under what conditions? | **D** | Use `A.2.8` for the generic-prescription or individual-duty route; only the individual route cites one separately obtaining commitment. For a grant use `A.2.8.PER`: name the exact grant occurrence, beneficiary, action, scope/window, and policy-valid A.2.9 act with its performer and assignment; confirm current policy conditions and absence of valid revocation or supersession; cite evidence needed before reliance. |
| **Gate predicate or result** | Does the sentence state the mechanism condition for entry, or claim one actual `A.21` decision for a bounded action? | **A** for the entry predicate; **E** for the actual decision result | Keep the mechanism predicate as its own `A-*` claim. For an actual decision, use one separate `E-*` claim naming the exact `GateDecisionResult`, bounded action, applicable profile application, complete required `GateCheckApplicationResult` set, scope/window, `decisionValue`, action consequence, and recheck condition. A grant, finding, or conflict is only an input; neither the predicate nor the result creates or resolves it. |
| **Actual exercise** | Did this dated Work match the named grant's action and beneficiary while that grant was in force? | **E** | Use `A.2.8.PER PermissionExerciseRelation@Context`: name the exact Work, grant occurrence, performer/assignment or on-behalf-of ground, scope, and interval. A failed match means that exercise relation does not obtain. |
| **Weak evaluation or non-violation** | Did an evaluation of a current, sufficiently complete normative frame find no applicable prohibition before action, or no violation in the actual Work? | **E** | Use the exact `NonProhibitionFinding@Context` or `NonViolationFinding@Context`, its evaluation Work, frame, subject/action or Work, scope, and window. A stale or incomplete frame returns `unresolved`. |
| **Conflict** | Do a current grant and norm cover the same case, and has a rule or authorized decision actually selected the outcome? | **E** | Use `A.2.8.PER PermissionNormConflictFinding@Context`. Cite the applicable selecting rule or the admitted system's authorized dated decision Work and current resolution result; otherwise keep the finding `unresolved`. |
| **Source or display only** | Does the sentence only say that a permit, badge, registry entry, message, or carrier exists, displays, or evidences something? | **E** for an observed carrier/evidence claim; **L** for its definition | Use A.10/G.6 for evidence and the applicable publication or carrier pattern. A visible or published item is not itself a grant, exercise, finding, or resolution. |

Choose one row. If one sentence answers two questions, split it before classification. If the sentence is not permission-like, do not use this branch. The branch classifies claims and selects existing subject patterns; it creates no `permission result` umbrella. Use the filled case in §8.4.5.4 when a concrete model is needed; point back to that case rather than adding another pattern list.

**Guideline.** Keep gate semantics independent of specific evidence carriers:
write the gate predicate in `A-*`; when an actual observation or result is stated,
put it in `E-*` and reference the gate (`E → A`). `A-*` claims MUST NOT reference `E-*` (no upward dependencies), even though `E-*` is used to adjudicate gate satisfaction.

**Step 4 — Link by ID or canonical location, not by paraphrase.** Apply the
cross-quadrant restrictions in §6.4, including its explicitly informative-note
exception for L references to A/D/E. Same-quadrant references remain available.

**Common link motifs (informative).** The most reusable boundary rewrites use the canonical motifs: `D→A`, `E→A`, `D→E`, `A/E→L`, and `D→L`.

**Step 5 — Bind references (minimal A.7 discipline).**

* Place **L** claims in `Signature.Laws` (and mechanism-local semantic laws if present), and **A** claims in `Mechanism.AdmissibilityConditions`.
* Bind a generic **D** claim to its exact normative episteme and applicable rule content. Bind an individual-duty **D** claim to its actual duty-bearing System or separately governed party and exact `U.Commitment`; cite an assignment only when the constitutive rule uses it as a ground. State responsibility and authority, when claimed, through their own admitted direct relations or exact missing governors. Prefer ID or canonical-location references rather than restating `L-*` or `A-*` content.
* Bind each **E** claim first to its exact predicate/object and to the actual work, evaluation, observation, scope/window, comparison frame, and other conditions that settle that predicate. Add a carrier/schema, evidence or source-use relation, viewpoint, and consumer only when a receiving reliance decision depends on them; a claim about a carrier's own existence or condition names the carrier as its object.

**Optional drift-control.** Add each L/A/D/E-classified claim verbatim to a Claim Register row (A.6.B:7) with canonical location + references so faces can cite by ID or canonical location without paraphrase.

**Step 6 — Recompose into readable text.**
Include only the claim classes present in the source. Use separate Tech and Plain
forms when their readers need them; both may also serve as a teaching aid.

* **Tech recomposition**: a short **L/A/D/E-classified claim bundle** listing the
  present claims and their ID or canonical-location references.
* **Plain recomposition**: a one-paragraph narrative that *summarizes* the bundle
  and cites its claims (**no new semantics**). If you need a new constraint, add a
  new atomic L/A/D/E-classified claim to the canonical source before publishing it
  in Plain.

##### A.6.B:8.4.2 - Anti-pattern (quick)

* **AP-1 Unestablished operational-result guarantees.** An asserted operational
  result lacks the actual Work, evaluation, or observation needed to settle it.
  If the guarantee's L/A/D/E meaning is ambiguous, use `A.6.C:4.3` to recover it.
* **AP-2 Interface-as-promiser.** Non-agent objects “promise or commit”.
* **AP-3 Gate-as-evidence.** Treating the gate predicate (A) as if it were an observation (E).
* **AP-4 Gate-as-law.** Entry predicates as signature “laws or definitions” (L) instead of `A-*`.
* **AP-5 Adjective smuggling.** “fast, secure, approved, or aligned” used instead of qualifiers or slots.
* **AP-6 Paraphrase drift.** Restating L/A content in D or E with changed meaning (instead of citing by ID or canonical location).
* **AP-7 Deontics in predicates.** RFC keywords (“MUST, SHALL, and related RFC keywords”) used as operators inside `L-*` or `A-*` predicates (should be `D-*` that references `L-*`/`A-*`).
* **AP-8 View-fork semantics.** Recomposition/face text introduces new `L/A/D/E` meaning not present in the L/A/D/E-classified claim set (violates “no new semantics” discipline).
* **AP-9 Applicability-as-gate.** Using `Signature.Applicability` (intended use) as a substitute for `A-*` runtime admission predicates.

##### A.6.B:8.4.3 - Example 1 — Software engineering (SLO-ish API latency)

###### A.6.B:8.4.3.1 - Draft sentence (non-conformant)

> “This API guarantees p95 latency < 200ms.”

###### A.6.B:8.4.3.2 - Atomize + Classify (L/A/D/E)

**L-API-01 (Definition).**
`p95_latency(window W, population P, unit U, method M)` is defined as … (formal measurement definition).
*(Lives in Signature.Laws or a referenced measurement definition pack.)*

**L-API-02 (Interface signature).**
The API endpoints and parameters are as declared (including parameter passing discipline / units).
*(Signature-level structure.)*

**A-API-01 (Gate predicate: admissibility).**
The claim “p95 < 200ms” is admissible **only under** declared load profile + deployment region + sampling method + window:
`AdmissibleLatencyClaim := (region=US) ∧ (concurrency≤X) ∧ (payload≤Y) ∧ (W=5m) ∧ (M=HDRHistogram@v…) ∧ (P=requests that match filter F)`
*(References L-API-01 for definition.)*

**D-API-01 (Commitment).**
Admitted service-maintaining system `ServiceOperations-A` is the actual duty bearer of separately obtaining `LatencyCommitment-API-01 : U.Commitment`; under that commitment it SHALL meet `p95_latency < 200ms` when `A-API-01` holds, adjudicated per `L-API-01` using the carriers and observation conditions in `E-API-01`.
*(References L-API-01 and A-API-01 by ID; does not restate them.)*

**D-API-02 (Operational duty).**
Admitted operations system `SRE-A` is the actual duty bearer of separately obtaining `IncidentNoteCommitment-API-02 : U.Commitment`; it SHALL publish incident notes when `LatencyCommitment-API-01` is violated and SHALL avoid claiming compliance outside `A-API-01`.
*(References D-API-01 and A-API-01 by ID.)*

**E-API-01 (Evidence / carriers).**
For `LatencyEvaluation-T1` over `Γ_time=[t1..t2]`, actual carriers `TraceBatch-T1`, `Histogram-H1`, `DashboardSnapshot-D1`, and `SamplingConfiguration-S1` were produced or observed under the operating and sampling conditions in `A-API-01`, using the metric and computation definition in `L-API-01`. An A.10 evidence-provenance path links those exact carriers to `LatencyEvaluation-T1` and its `LatencyResult-T1`.
*(References `A-API-01` and `L-API-01`; avoids RFC deontics; does not cite `D-*`.)*

**D-API-03 (Duty-to-evidence linkage).**
Admitted telemetry-maintaining system `TelemetryOperations-A` is the actual duty bearer of separately obtaining `TelemetryRetentionCommitment-API-03 : U.Commitment`; it SHALL retain or expose the actual carriers referenced in `E-API-01` for the audit window required by policy.
*(References E-API-01 by ID.)*

**E-API-02 (Observed value claim).**
For interval `Γ_time = [t1..t2]` under conditions pinned to `A-API-01` and using carriers in `E-API-01`, `LatencyEvaluation-T1` produced `LatencyResult-T1` with observed `p95_latency = 173ms` (computed per `L-API-01`).
*(References A-API-01, L-API-01 and E-API-01.)*

###### A.6.B:8.4.3.3 - Triangle decomposition (explicit)

* **A-API-01** is “the predicate”.
* **D-API-01 → A-API-01** states the commitment under the gate or envelope.
* **E-API-01 → A-API-01** binds adjudication (carriers used to decide the gate or commitment).
* **D-API-03 → E-API-01** expresses retention and exposure obligations for those carriers.

###### A.6.B:8.4.3.4 - Readable recomposition

**Tech recomposition (L/A/D/E-classified claim bundle, short):**

* `L-API-01` defines p95 latency computation.
* `A-API-01` specifies when the latency claim is admissible.
* `D-API-01` states the commitment under that envelope.
* `E-API-01` lists adjudicable carriers and conditions used to adjudicate `A-API-01`.
* `D-API-02` states the operational incident-note duties.
* `D-API-03` states the retention and exposure duties for carriers in `E-API-01`.
* `E-API-02` reports observed performance under `A-API-01` for `Γ_time=[t1..t2]`.

**Plain recomposition (one paragraph, readable):**
“The API’s latency target uses the p95 definition in **L-API-01**, and the mechanism admits its evaluation only under operating envelope **A-API-01**. `ServiceOperations-A` has the latency duty stated in **D-API-01**. Adjudication uses the telemetry carriers listed in **E-API-01**; `TelemetryOperations-A` has the retention duty in **D-API-03**, and `SRE-A` has the incident-note duty in **D-API-02**. Under that envelope, the observed p95 over `Γ_time=[t1..t2]` was `173ms` (**E-API-02**).”

##### A.6.B:8.4.4 - Example 2 — Mechanical engineering (fit / coaxiality)

###### A.6.B:8.4.4.1 - Draft sentence (non-conformant)

> “This fit ensures coaxiality.”

###### A.6.B:8.4.4.2 - Atomize + Classify

**L-FIT-01 (Definition).**
`coaxiality` is defined relative to a declared base axis and measurement method (datum scheme, instrument, tolerance zone).
*(Truth-conditional: “what it means”.)*

**L-FIT-02 (Interface and boundary structure).**
The boundary relation involves shaft, bushing, datum axis, tolerance class, temperature window, assembly procedure class.
*(Signature-level arity recovery / slots.)*

**A-FIT-01 (Gate predicate).**
The coaxiality claim is admissible only if manufacturing and assembly satisfy the declared process envelope: material batch, temperature window, tool calibration validity, surface finish class, alignment procedure version.
*(Gate predicate; can be checked using evidence, but is not itself evidence.)*

**D-FIT-01 (Duty).**
Admitted production-engineering system `ProcessEngineer-A` is the actual duty bearer of separately obtaining `ProcessEnvelopeCommitment-FIT-01 : U.Commitment`; it SHALL ensure `A-FIT-01` holds for the production lot and SHALL not release the lot for use when `A-FIT-01` is false.
*(References A-FIT-01.)*

**E-FIT-01 (Evidence carriers).**
For `CoaxialityEvaluation-L123` over lot `L123` and `Γ_time=[t1..t2]`, actual carriers `CMMReport-L123`, `CalibrationCertificate-C7`, `AssemblyLog-L123`, `TemperatureTrace-L123`, and `DatumSchemePin-D4` were produced or observed. An A.10 evidence-provenance path links those exact carriers to `CoaxialityEvaluation-L123` and its `CoaxialityResult-L123`.
*(References `A-FIT-01` and `L-FIT-01`; avoids RFC deontics.)*

**D-FIT-02 (Duty-to-evidence linkage).**
Admitted quality-engineering system `QualityEngineer-A` is the actual duty bearer of separately obtaining `FitEvidenceRetentionCommitment-02 : U.Commitment`; it SHALL retain or expose the carriers referenced in `E-FIT-01` for the production lot.
*(References E-FIT-01 by ID.)*

**E-FIT-02 (Observed).**
For lot `L123` and window `Γ_time=[t1..t2]`, under conditions pinned to `A-FIT-01` and using carriers in `E-FIT-01`, `CoaxialityEvaluation-L123` produced `CoaxialityResult-L123`: measured coaxiality was within tolerance zone `T` (interpreted per `L-FIT-01`).
*(References A-FIT-01, L-FIT-01, and E-FIT-01.)*

###### A.6.B:8.4.4.3 - Readable recomposition

**Tech bundle:**

* Meaning of coaxiality: `L-FIT-01`.
* Boundary arity and participants: `L-FIT-02`.
* When the claim is admissible: `A-FIT-01`.
* Who has the process-envelope duty: `ProcessEngineer-A` under `D-FIT-01`.
* What we observe and keep as carriers: `E-FIT-01` and measured outcome `E-FIT-02` (with retention duty `D-FIT-02`).

**Plain paragraph:**
“‘Ensures coaxiality’ is made precise by fixing the definition and datum scheme (**L-FIT-01**) and by making the boundary participants explicit (**L-FIT-02**). The mechanism admits this coaxiality evaluation only under the declared manufacturing and assembly envelope (**A-FIT-01**). `ProcessEngineer-A` has the process-envelope duty stated in **D-FIT-01**. Compliance is adjudicated using the measurement and process carriers listed in **E-FIT-01**; for lot `L123` over `Γ_time=[t1..t2]`, the observed coaxiality was within tolerance **E-FIT-02**.”

##### A.6.B:8.4.5 - Example 3 — Management (project “approved or aligned”)

###### A.6.B:8.4.5.1 - Draft sentence (non-conformant)

> “The project is approved.”

###### A.6.B:8.4.5.2 - Atomize + Classify

**L-PRJ-01 (Definition).**
`approved(project, approvalKind)` is defined as a relation kind; approval kinds include: “sponsor-signoff”, “stage-gate-pass”, “budget-authorized”, “staffing-assigned”, etc.
*(Truth-conditional: disambiguates kind and polarity.)*

**A-PRJ-01 (Gate predicate: stage entry).**
For starting execution work, `ExecutionAdmissible(project)` holds iff required approvals are present *and* required prerequisites are satisfied (e.g., risk review completed, budget line exists, key roles staffed).
*(This is the real “may start work” entry predicate; it references L-PRJ-01 for what counts as approvals. If “approved” is meant as permission rather than gate evidence, use the permission-word branch in §8.4.1. An approval registry entry or evidence carrier alone remains source/display evidence and is not a grant.)*

**D-PRJ-01 (Duty).**
Admitted project-coordination system `ProjectCoordinator-A` is the actual duty bearer of separately obtaining `ProjectEntryCommitment-PRJ-01 : U.Commitment`; it SHALL not initiate execution unless `A-PRJ-01` holds, SHALL keep the approval registry current, and SHALL retain or expose the evidence carriers referenced in `E-PRJ-02`.
*(References A-PRJ-01 and E-PRJ-02 by ID.)*

**E-PRJ-01 (Gate decision result).**
At `Γ_time=snapshot(t)`, `ProjectEntryGateResult-P-t : GateDecisionResult` has `gateRef=ProjectEntryGate-P`, `decisionSubjectRef=ProjectEntryClaim-P-t`, `boundedActionRef=StartExecution-P`, and `profileApplicationRef=ProjectEntryProfileApplication-P-t`. That application of `ProjectEntryProfile-v3` uses the complete required set `{ApprovalCheck-P-t, RiskReviewCheck-P-t, BudgetCheck-P-t, StaffingCheck-P-t} : GateCheckApplicationResult[]`; each exact application reports its checked subject and criterion, has `sourceOutcome=satisfied`, and maps to `pass`. The result records `decisionValue=pass`, action consequence “start `StartExecution-P` within the admitted project-entry window”, the project-entry scope and window, and recheck on any changed approval, risk-review, budget, staffing, profile, scope, or window.
*(This actual `E-*` result applies the inputs named by `A-PRJ-01`; it is neither the `A-*` predicate nor performed execution Work.)*

**E-PRJ-02 (Evidence for reliance).**
For reliance on `E-PRJ-01`, the exact observed carrier set is `{DecisionRecord-R7, MeetingMinutes-M3, BudgetLine-B4, StaffingAssignments-S2, GateChecklistSnapshot-G9}`. An A.10 evidence-provenance path links those carriers to the four exact `GateCheckApplicationResult` values and `ProjectEntryGateResult-P-t`. `GateChecklistSnapshot-G9` displays the result; its presence alone establishes neither a check result nor the gate decision.
*(References `A-PRJ-01` and `E-PRJ-01`; avoids RFC deontics.)*

###### A.6.B:8.4.5.3 - Readable recomposition

**Tech bundle:**

* “Approved” is not one relation: `L-PRJ-01` defines approval kinds.
* “May start execution” is a gate predicate: `A-PRJ-01`.
* `ProjectCoordinator-A`'s project-entry duty: `D-PRJ-01`.
* The actual A.21 gate result is `E-PRJ-01`; its bounded A.10 evidence support is `E-PRJ-02`.

**Plain paragraph:**
“Instead of a generic ‘approved’, we select an explicit approval kind as defined in **L-PRJ-01** and treat ‘may start execution’ as an admissibility predicate (**A-PRJ-01**). `ProjectCoordinator-A` has the project-entry and registry-maintenance duties stated in **D-PRJ-01**. At snapshot `t`, the current A.21 profile application maps every required check-application result to `pass`; **E-PRJ-01** records `decisionValue=pass` with the action consequence ‘start `StartExecution-P` within the stated window’, and **E-PRJ-02** supplies the exact evidence path for reliance on that result.”

###### A.6.B:8.4.5.4 - Filled permission case (each sentence classified)

**E-CAL-01 (Instituting communicative Work).** Admitted system `MaintenanceCoordinator-A` performed dated `CalibrationGrantAct-17 : U.SpeechAct` under `MaintenanceCoordinator-A@DayShift`; that obtaining assignment has the system as holder and covers the act. In this filled case, `CalibrationGrantPolicy-v4` does not require a separate authority relation, so none is asserted. The assignment supplies no authority and performs no act. `CalibrationGrantAct-17` satisfies the policy in `PlantCalibrationContext` and is the actual instituting Work. A policy variant that does require grant authority must cite one exact obtaining authority relation under its direct predicate or stop at `missing-governor[grant authority]`.

**D-CAL-01 (Grant position).** `MaintenanceCalibrationGrant-17 : GrantedPermissionRelation@Context`, instituted by `CalibrationGrantAct-17`—the actual speech act stated in `E-CAL-01`—permits beneficiary `MaintenanceTechnicianSystemRole` to run `CalibrationProcedure-v3` in Zone 8 during `ServiceWindow-17`. `CalibrationGrantPolicy-v4` remains current, the grant still covers that system-role kind, procedure, zone, and window, and no valid revocation or supersession has ended this occurrence; this `D-*` claim records the grant but does not institute it.

**A-CAL-01 (Gate predicate).** `CalibrationEntryAdmissible(plan, checkTime)` holds only if `MaintenanceCalibrationGrant-17` is current for the plan's beneficiary, action, zone, and time and no applicable permission/norm conflict finding is `unresolved`. The predicate takes those inputs; it creates neither the grant, a conflict result, nor an actual gate decision.

**E-CAL-02 (Actual Work and actor).** Through its A.13 core, admitted system `Tech-17` is the exact actual performer for this case under obtaining assignment `Tech-17@Shift-B`, whose holder is `Tech-17` and whose extent covers the early part of `ServiceWindow-17`. A.15.1 independently admits dated `CalibrationWork-17B : U.Work` from that performer, its Method, extent, and containing-System facts. Because this filled case expressly claims precise assignment-bound attribution, F.6 separately relates `CalibrationWork-17B` to that same assignment. The assignment neither acts nor identifies the performer; failed attribution would leave the Work intact and remove only the under-assignment claim.

**E-CAL-03 (Optional exercise claim).** Because this case asks whether the grant was used, `CalibrationExercise-17B : PermissionExerciseRelation@Context` connects `CalibrationWork-17B` to `MaintenanceCalibrationGrant-17`: the Work instantiates `CalibrationProcedure-v3`; `Tech-17@Shift-B` is an assignment occurrence whose declared species uses `MaintenanceTechnicianSystemRoleKindDomain` as its assigned-kind domain, and the occurrence supplies `MaintenanceTechnicianSystemRole` as the value admitted by that domain; and the Work occurs in Zone 8 within `ServiceWindow-17` while the grant is current. If the action or beneficiary test failed, this exercise relation would not obtain.

**D-CAL-02 (Exercise non-use boundary).** The authoring rule says to add `E-CAL-03` only when the reader needs to know whether the grant was exercised; otherwise stop with the separately named grant and Work. This is a generic prescription for boundary text, not a claim that one particular author bears an individual `U.Commitment`.

**E-CAL-04 (Later non-violation finding).** Through its A.13 core, admitted system `ComplianceEvaluator-4` is the exact actual performer under obtaining assignment `ComplianceEvaluator-4@QualityShift`. A.15.1 independently admits dated `CalibrationComplianceEvaluation-17B : U.Work`; because this finding expressly preserves precise assignment-bound attribution, F.6 separately relates that Work to the same assignment. The Work checked `CalibrationWork-17B` against current `PlantCalibrationNormativeFrame-17`, explicitly complete enough for this technician, procedure, zone, and evaluation window, and returned `CalibrationNonViolation-17B : NonViolationFinding@Context(result=nonViolating)`. A stale or insufficient frame would return `unresolved`; a missing or failed F.6 relation would instead leave the Work and evaluation result intact while removing only the attribution.

**E-CAL-05 (Evidence for reliance).** An A.10 evidence-provenance path links the exact `CalibrationNonViolation-17B` finding to `CalibrationComplianceEvaluation-17B`, `ComplianceEvaluator-4@QualityShift`, `CalibrationRunLog-17B`, the log's source and currentness relations, and the bounded audit context. The path supports reliance on the finding; the log, assignment, and path do not perform the evaluation or create its result.

**E-CAL-06 (Unresolved conflict).** After `CalibrationWork-17B` and its evaluation, `Zone8EntryProhibition-17` becomes current for the same beneficiary, action, zone, and the remaining service window, including the calibration action specified by `CalibrationWorkPlan-17C`; no applicable rule selects an outcome and no authorized dated decision Work with a current resolution result exists. `CalibrationConflict-17 : PermissionNormConflictFinding@Context` therefore remains `unresolved`.

**E-CAL-07 (Source/display fact).** `SignedGrantRecord-17` and `GreenPermitTile-17` are visible carriers in this case; their presence is an observed source/display claim only.

**E-CAL-08 (Gate decision result).** At the later entry check, `CalibrationEntryResult-17C : GateDecisionResult` has `gateRef=CalibrationEntryGate-17`, `decisionSubjectRef=CalibrationWorkPlan-17C`, `boundedActionRef=StartCalibrationProcedure-v3-in-Zone8-17C`, and `profileApplicationRef=CalibrationEntryProfileApplication-17C`. The current profile application uses the complete required set `{CalibrationGrantCurrentCheck-17C, CalibrationConflictResolvedCheck-17C} : GateCheckApplicationResult[]`: the current-grant application maps to `pass`, while the exact `CalibrationConflict-17=unresolved` source outcome maps to `block`. The result records `decisionValue=block`, action consequence “hold `CalibrationWorkPlan-17C` outside entry”, the remaining Zone 8 service scope and window, and recheck when the grant, conflict result, profile, scope, or window changes. It neither resolves the conflict nor revokes `MaintenanceCalibrationGrant-17`.

**L-CAL-01 (Tempting wrong classification, rejected).** “The visible permit is D, so the grant exists, the Work exercised it, and the Work was non-violating” is not one atomic claim and is false as a classification shortcut. The carrier observation is `E-CAL-07`; the grant, exercise, evaluation finding, and `E-CAL-08` gate result remain the separately classified claims above.

##### A.6.B:8.4.6 - A compact recomposition aid

Include only the claim classes present in the source; use separate Tech and Plain
forms when their readers need them. Cite claim IDs or canonical locations.

###### A.6.B:8.4.6.1 - Tech register (2–5 lines)

> “This boundary claim is defined by **L-…** and applies only under **A-…**. **D-…** states either the exact generic prescription or the separately instituted duty of **[actual bearer]**. **E-…** states the observed or evaluated result for `Γ_time=…`; add its evidence support when the receiving use needs it.”

###### A.6.B:8.4.6.2 - Plain register (1 paragraph)

> “We mean **[short label]** in the sense of **L-…**, and use it only when **A-…** holds. **D-…** either states what the named policy requires or, when an individual duty was separately instituted, names its actual bearer. **E-…** states the observed or evaluated result for the declared interval; add its evidence support when the receiving use needs it. If responsibility is also claimed, cite its direct relation separately.”

### A.6.B:9 — Bias‑Annotation

Scope: **Universal** for boundary descriptions.

* **Arch bias:** favors explicit separation and explicit references; mitigated by allowing narrative faces while keeping commitments classified and referenced by ID or canonical location.
* **Gov bias:** makes actual duty bearers and duties explicit (D) and auditability explicit (E); mitigated by keeping evidence conceptual and carrier-referenced rather than tool-specific. Responsibility, when claimed, remains a separate direct relation.
* **Ontological and Epistemic bias:** insists on EntityOfConcern, Description episteme, and carrier and on work‑adjudicated effects; mitigated by providing clear cross‑quadrant link patterns so authors can still express real‑world governance needs.

### A.6.B:10 — Conformance Checklist

| ID                                       | Requirement                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Purpose                                                  |
| ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| **CC‑A.6.B.1 (Atomicity).**              | A conforming boundary text **SHALL** decompose mixed sentences into **atomic claims** such that each atomic claim belongs to exactly one quadrant **L/A/D/E**.                                                    | Makes L/A/D/E classification unambiguous; prevents contract soup.       |
| **CC‑A.6.B.2 (Quadrant classification).** | Each atomic claim **MUST** be classified by its own modality and adjudication position, not by its subject-pattern family. When permission wording is present, the single branch in §8.4.1 **MUST** select the claim's job before assigning L/A/D/E. | Prevents one pattern catalogue from replacing the square's decision. |
| **CC‑A.6.B.3 (Form and obtaining constraints).** | `L-*` and `A-*` claims **MUST NOT** use RFC deontic keywords as operators. A generic-prescription `D-*` claim **MUST** name its exact normative source and applicable rule content without inventing an individual occurrence; an individual-duty `D-*` claim **MUST** name its actual bearer and exact separately obtaining `U.Commitment`; a grant `D-*` claim **MUST** satisfy §8.4.1. No claim text makes its relation obtain. Responsibility uses its direct predicate or exact missing governor. An `E-*` claim **MUST** name the work, evaluation, or observation that settles it and any evidence used for reliance. | Keeps normative content, individual institution, responsibility, and evaluated results distinct. |
| **CC‑A.6.B.4 (Explicit references).**    | Where a claim depends on another L/A/D/E-classified claim, that dependency **MUST** be expressed by explicit ID or canonical-location reference rather than restating the other claim in new words.                                                | Prevents paraphrase drift across layers and faces.           |
| **CC‑A.6.B.5 (E‑claim adjudicability).** | Each `E-*` claim names its exact predicate and object plus the actual work, evaluation, or observation, scope/window, comparison frame, and other conditions required to settle that predicate. It adds an evidence/source-use relation, carrier/schema, viewpoint, and consumer only when the receiving reliance decision depends on that support. | Makes work-effects adjudicable without forcing unrelated carrier apparatus into every result claim. |
| **CC‑A.6.B.6 (No gate smuggling).**      | Operational admissibility predicates **MUST NOT** appear as `L-*` laws in the signature layer; they **MUST** be `A-*` claims in the mechanism layer.                                                             | Preserves substitution and signature stability.          |
| **CC‑A.6.B.7 (No upward dependencies).** | `L-*` claims **MUST NOT** reference `A-*`, `D-*`, or `E-*`, except for purely informative notes explicitly marked informative; `A-*` and `E-*` claims **MUST NOT** reference `D-*`. These are cross-quadrant restrictions under §6.4.                                                                                                   | Preserves layering and prevents hidden coupling.         |

### A.6.B:11 - Common Anti‑Patterns and How to Avoid Them

| Anti‑pattern                 | Symptom                                            | Why it fails                                                | Repair (square‑consistent)                                                                  |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Gate‑as‑law**              | Preconditions written as “laws”                    | Collapses signature or mechanism boundary; breaks substitution | Move to `A-*` in Mechanism.AdmissibilityConditions; reference `L-*` terms.                  |
| **Deontics in predicates**   | “MUST” inside definitions or gates                 | Confuses governance with truth or admissibility                | Rewrite the definition or gate as `L-*`/`A-*`; add a generic `D-*` prescription or an independently established individual-duty claim when current. |
| **Interface‑as‑promiser**    | “The API promises or guarantees …”                    | Category error: interface descriptions do not commit              | Recover the exact policy and generic prescription, or the actual bearer and separately obtaining `U.Commitment` when an individual duty is claimed; keep measured property (`E-*`) and metric definition (`L-*`) separate, and use `A.6.C` when ambiguity in that wording changes the claim's interpretation or use. |
| **Unestablished operational-result guarantees** | An asserted p95 result lacks its actual evaluation | The operational-result claim lacks the basis needed to settle it | Use `A.6.C:4.3` when the guarantee's meaning is ambiguous. For an operational result, state the actual Work, evaluation, or observation, predicate and object, scope/window, and result; if that basis is absent, leave the result unestablished. Add A.10 support and a `D-* → E-*` link only when the receiving reliance and duty claims need them. A carrier-existence observation alone does not complete the measured claim. |
| **Paraphrase drift**         | Same rule restated across faces                    | Divergence becomes invisible                                | Use claim IDs or canonical locations; faces cite them; optional Claim Register.                                           |
| **View‑fork semantics**      | A face introduces new L/A/D/E content              | Violates “no new semantics” publication discipline          | Put any new boundary claim in its canonical source before publishing it on a face. Mark explanatory commentary informative when it adds no boundary semantics.                  |

### A.6.B:12 — Consequences

| Benefits                                                                                                     | Trade‑offs / mitigations                                                                         |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Stable modular boundaries.** Laws don’t accidentally become gates; governance doesn’t masquerade as truth. | Requires writers to split sentences; mitigated by the triangle decomposition pattern.            |
| **Explicit adjudication links.** Commitments can be linked to adjudicable evidence carriers.                | Requires evidence to be designed; mitigated by keeping evidence conceptual and carrier-referenced. |
| **Reduced semantic drift across faces.** IDs + explicit references reduce drift caused by restatement.            | More cross‑references; mitigated by a Claim Register (optional but recommended).                 |

### A.6.B:13 — Rationale

The square is an authoring primitive that forces an explicit choice across two distinctions that are otherwise routinely conflated:

* **Truth vs governance** (what is the case vs what is required or committed), and
* **Description vs work** (what can be decided by reading vs what must be decided by observing execution).

By requiring atomicity and explicit cross‑quadrant references, the square converts “contract talk” into a set of classified, evolvable claims with clear adjudication semantics.

### A.6.B:14 — SoTA‑Echoing (post‑2015 practice alignment)

> **Informative.** Alignment notes; not normative requirements.

**Representative sources (post‑2015; illustrative).** See also A.6:11 for a fuller list.
* ISO/IEC/IEEE 42010:2022 (`U.View` and `U.Viewpoint` discipline).
* Leijen (2017) / Hillerström & Lindley (2018) (effects & handlers).
* OpenTelemetry Specification (v1.0+, 2021–) (evidence carriers as traces, logs, and metrics).

* **Effect systems & handlers:** clear separation between operation signature (L), handler and runtime behavior (A/E), and generic prescriptions or separately instituted duties (D); only the latter name an actual operating or implementing System as bearer.
* **Behavioural and session typing:** protocol laws (L) and admissibility (A) remain distinct from commitments (D) and runtime traces (E), improving interpretability of “progress and safety” style boundary guarantees.
* **SRE and observability discipline:** treating traces, logs, and metrics as evidence carriers (E) and separating evidence semantics from retention and exposure duties (D) mirrors contemporary operational practice while staying tool‑agnostic.

### A.6.B:15 — Relations

* **Used by A.6 and A.6.C:** supplies the canonical matrix and cross-quadrant link discipline. Both consumers classify each exact atomic claim by predicate and adjudication, keep the claim episteme separate from its EntityOfConcern, and use the §8.4.1 branch only when permission wording is live.
* **Constrains A.6.0 (`U.Signature`):** enforces that `L-*` laws are truth‑conditional and do not include admissibility predicates.
* **Constrains A.6.1 (`U.Mechanism`):** enforces that admissibility lives in `AdmissibilityConditions` (`A-*`) and that evidence semantics are classified as `E-*` with carrier references.
* **Requires A.7:** identifies each claim's EntityOfConcern separately from the
  episteme carrying it. The concern may itself be a Description episteme or
  publication carrier.
* **Interacts with MVPK/E.17:** faces are projections that cite L/A/D/E-classified claims and mint no new semantics. When the permission-word branch is selected, its row names the subject pattern and obtaining or failure test; A.6.B only classifies the statement, and neither wording nor a carrier makes the referenced object obtain.

### A.6.B:15a - Probe-coupled boundary claim classification

When boundary text says that an interaction changes the state represented by its
output, identify the interaction, the changed state, and the receiving use, then
classify the atomic claims through the same L/A/D/E square. Such interactions may
include asking a question, measuring or intervening through a metric, reading a
dashboard, conducting a workshop, exporting through a Bridge, or making an API
read. Probe-coupled boundary language does not create a fifth quadrant.

Action classification:

1. Copy the boundary sentence being used for a decision.
2. Split it into its atomic claims before judging it, retaining only the classes
   present in the source: definition or law, runtime admissibility, generic
   prescription or individual duty, work effect or evaluated result, and any
   separate evidence-support claim.
3. Give each atomic claim its quadrant and any identifier required by a later reference.
4. Put the state, probe, update, or export part in the quadrant where it belongs rather than treating "quantum-like boundary" as one claim.
5. Apply `A.6.P` to reusable relation words; use `F.18` only when recovered terms
   need durable names. Use `A.10` for needed evidence support, `B.3` for a named
   assurance question, `C.16` for measurement, and `F.9` for a Bridge question.
   Use `C.26.1` for the residual probe-coupled question only when the interaction
   participates in the represented state and its output is being used as a
   passive read or export despite that decision-relevant effect.
6. Use a Claim Register row set only when the classified claim set is
   decision-bearing, reusable, contested, assurance-facing, or likely to be cited
   across faces; otherwise keep the atomic prose.

For a local working note, atomize the sentence mentally and write one or more
atomic L/A/D/E-classified sentences, preserving every source claim. One sentence
suffices only when one logical job remains. Use the Claim Register when the claim
set must survive reuse or dispute; the phrase "quantum-like boundary" is not a
substitute for its separate claims.

| Quantum-like boundary phrase hides | Claim class | What the user writes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| The term, variable, state, frame, or relation being defined | `L-*` law or definition claim | Definition or invariant, without agent obligation language |
| When a mechanism admits use of a probe, metric, question, or bridge at the decision point; declaration-level intended-use scope remains in `Signature.Applicability` | `A-*` runtime-admissibility claim | Entry predicate, required current inputs, non-admitted outcome, and neighboring-pattern continuation |
| What exact policy prescribes about applying, retaining, exposing, or avoiding overuse of the probe result; or which actual bearer has that individually instituted duty; and, if separately claimed, who bears responsibility | generic `D-*` prescription or individual `D-*` claim about one exact `U.Commitment`; separate direct responsibility claim or missing governor | Exact normative source and rule content for the generic branch; actual duty bearer and referenced L/A/E claim IDs or canonical locations for the individual branch; responsibility predicate and participants only when that relation independently obtains |
| The actual work effect or observed before-state or after-state, plus any separate evidence relation or carrier used for reliance | `E-*` work-effect or evaluated-result claim; separate evidence-support claim when current | Exact predicate and object, actual Work, evaluation, or observation, conditions and window, and result; add an A.10 evidence relation and exact carrier only when a receiving use relies on that support |

Useful outputs:

- a Claim Register row set when decision, reuse, contest, assurance, or cross-face
  citation needs it;
- one or more atomic L/A/D/E-classified sentences preserving every source claim
  for a local working note;
- an ordinary A.6.B L/A/D/E-classified claim set when no probe-coupled
  state-reading question remains;
- the `C.26.1:4.2` decision and finish result for a residual probe-coupled question
  that meets the activation condition above;
- the evidence-support, assurance, measurement, or Bridge result or continuation
  required by `A.10`, `B.3`, `C.16`, or `F.9` for the corresponding current question.

Do not write "the boundary is quantum-like" as one claim without L/A/D/E classification. Identify the interaction and its receiving use, split and classify the claims,
then apply the `C.26.1` activation condition above to any remaining question.
