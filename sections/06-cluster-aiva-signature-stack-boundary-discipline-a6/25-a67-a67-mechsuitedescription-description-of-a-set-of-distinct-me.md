## A.6.7 - `MechSuiteDescription` — Description of a set of distinct mechanisms

> **Type:** Architectural pattern.
> **Status:** Stable.
> **Normativity:** Normative [A] (Core).

**Use this when.** Several distinct mechanism intensions must be used together under shared obligations. Identify the members, cite the required specifications, and state any permitted ordering.

A `MechSuiteDescription` is a Kernel **Description** token that names a **set of distinct** `U.Mechanism.Intension` (different mechanisms, not realizations of one mechanism) and declares **suite-level obligations**, **required spec pins**, and any **allowed usage protocols**, without conflating this with `MechFamilyDescription` or with publication `Pack`s.

**Plain-name.** mechanism suite description; mechanism suite passport.

**Builds on.** A.6.1 (`U.Mechanism.Intension` canonical form), A.6.5 (SlotSpecs where a RelationSignature is current), E.10 (lexical + ontological rules; strict distinction; minimal specificity; kind suffixes), E.18 (transformation-flow structure and crossing visibility), E.18.1 (P2W carry-through), A.21 (gate-level decisions).

**Used by.** Mechanism stacks governed by **shared admissibility, transport and audit obligations** and declared mechanism intensions, including shared suites reused by Part G patterns such as G.5.

**Declared vocabulary and references.**

* **Declares:** `MechSuiteDescription` (KernelToken, Description) and the record names used by its canonical form: `MechSuiteId`, `SuiteObligation`, `SuiteObligations`, `SuiteSpecPins`, `SuiteProtocol`, `ProtocolStep`, `SuiteAuditObligations`.
* **Reuses (by reference):** `U.Mechanism.Intension` (members), `MechFamilyDescription` / `MechInstanceDescription` (optional citations), existing pinned references such as `CN‑Spec` / `CG‑Spec` (as pins), and E.18/P2W notions (as obligations/pins), without introducing new U-kinds.

**LEX.TokenClass.**
* `LEX.TokenClass(MechSuiteDescription) = KernelToken.`
* `LEX.TokenClass(MechSuiteId) = KernelToken.`
* `LEX.TokenClass(SuiteObligations) = KernelToken.`
* `LEX.TokenClass(SuiteSpecPins) = KernelToken.`
* `LEX.TokenClass(SuiteProtocol) = KernelToken.`
* `LEX.TokenClass(SuiteAuditObligations) = KernelToken.`

**EntityOfConcern.** A finite set of distinct mechanism intensions intended for joint use. The description's Tech name ends with `…Description`.
Lexical note: do **not** prefix this token with `U.`. The `U.*` namespace is for admitted U-kinds and governed kernel values; `MechSuiteDescription` is a description value for a suite of mechanism intensions, not a root kind.

### A.6.7:1 - Problem frame

In FPF, a **mechanism** is a node-level `U.Mechanism.Intension` with explicit argument and result declarations for each operation and a declared LawSet/guards/transport/audit (A.6.1). Many architectures, however, require **a stable bundle of multiple different mechanisms** that are intended to be used together under shared admissibility and crossing discipline (e.g., a characterization chain, an admissibility-gated selection pipeline, or a universal Part-G kernel that multiple `G.*` patterns must reuse).

FPF already has `MechFamilyDescription`, but its meaning is: **many realizations of one and the same `U.Mechanism.Intension`**. That construct cannot correctly represent a bundle of different mechanisms (different intensions), and trying to overload it creates a level error.

Additionally, FPF reserves “Pack” for publication/shipping bundling (e.g., G.10); using “Pack” to mean “container of mechanisms” creates ontological collisions and downstream confusion.

### A.6.7:2 - Problem

The suite user needs one description that can:

1. represent a **set of distinct mechanisms** (distinct `U.Mechanism.Intension`),
2. declare **shared obligations** that must hold across the set (e.g., crossing visibility, admissibility-citation discipline, guard decision format, penalty routing),
3. provide **shared spec pins** (e.g., “this suite is governed by CN-Spec and CG-Spec”), without duplicating those spec contents,
4. constrain **allowed protocols** of use (allowed pipelines / permitted ordering), without turning the suite into a mechanism, and
5. preserve strict distinction among:

   * a suite of mechanisms (`MechSuiteDescription`),
   * a family of realizations of one mechanism (`MechFamilyDescription`),
   * a publication bundle (`Pack`, e.g., G.10).

### A.6.7:3 - Forces

1. **Strict distinction (level hygiene).**
   *“many mechanisms”* must not be encoded as *“many realizations of one mechanism”*.
   Violating this blurs specialization laws, mechanism-declaration invariants, and audit/crossing responsibilities.

2. **Minimal specificity + kind suffix discipline (E.10).**
   The token name should encode only what is essential: it is a description, it is about mechanisms, it is a suite.
   It must not capture a particular domain (e.g., CHR) in the Kernel name.

3. **Governing spec ref centrality (CN‑Spec and CG‑Spec).**
   Suites must cite governing spec refs as pins, not duplicate their internals, otherwise multiple competing admissibility centers arise.

4. **Transport and crossing visibility discipline.**
   Cross-context and cross-plane steps must be visible and bridge-only; penalties must route to `R/R_eff` only; suites must not embed CL/Φ/Ψ/Φ_plane tables. Visibility is mediated via E.18 / P2W (crossing bundles + UTS/Path pins), not by “implicit semantics”.

5. **Guard vs gate separation.**
   Mechanisms can output tri-state guard outcomes and explanations; **gate decisions** (including `block`) and `DecisionLog` remain gate-level (`OperationalGate(profile)`). A suite must not collapse these layers.

6. **FPF is conceptual.**
   The suite is a conceptual descriptor: no implementation fields, no “lint rules”, no machine governance. The suite expresses obligations as conceptual constraints and required pins/anchors.

### A.6.7:4 - Solution

Declare the members and their shared conditions in a `MechSuiteDescription`:

#### A.6.7:4.1 `MechSuiteDescription` (data model)

`MechSuiteDescription` declares:

1. **Suite identifier:** a stable identifier for downstream citation.
2. **Membership:** a finite set of distinct mechanism intensions.
3. **Suite obligations:** shared invariants that every member (and any permitted composition of members) must respect.
4. **Suite spec pins:** required citations/pins to governing spec refs and other “anchor” references.
5. **Suite protocols:** allowed pipelines of use (permitted ordering and optional steps), expressed at the descriptive level.
6. **Suite audit obligations:** required audit/pin visibility for downstream uses (UTS/Path pins, crossing pins, guard pins), expressed as required anchors (not run-time values).
7. **Notes:** didactic boundaries and anti-pattern warnings.

A minimal canonical form:

```
MechSuiteId := Identifier  // PascalCase; stable citation handle. Versioning MAY be carried externally.

SuiteObligation := declared suite-level obligation
// Canonical reusable names (not exhaustive):
//   bridge_only_crossings,
//   two_bridge_rule_for_described_entity_change,
//   transport_declarative_only,
//   penalties_route_to_r_eff_only,
//   guard_decision_tristate(pass|degrade|abstain),
//   unknown_never_coerces_to_pass,
//   gate_decision_separation,
//   guard_lexeme_reservations,
//   cg_spec_cite_required_for_numeric_ops,
//   no_silent_scalarisation_of_partial_orders,
//   no_silent_totalisation,
//   no_thresholds_in_suite_core,
//   crossing_visibility_required,
//   planned_slot_filling_in_work_planning_only,
//   finalize_launch_values_in_work_enactment_only,
//   implementation_export_discipline_when_cited

SuiteObligations := { SuiteObligation[*] } // clause set; duplicates-free.

MechSuiteDescription := ⟨
  mech_suite_id: MechSuiteId ,
  mechanisms: U.Mechanism.IntensionRef[+] ,     // references to distinct member intensions
  suite_obligations: SuiteObligations ,
  suite_spec_pins: SuiteSpecPins ,
  suite_protocols?: SuiteProtocol[*] ,
  suite_audit_obligations?: SuiteAuditObligations ,
  suite_notes?: DidacticNotes
⟩
```

**Norms.**

* **Suite identifier.**
  `mech_suite_id` MUST be present and stable: it is the citation handle for downstream planning and `U.Work.Audit`.

**Well-formedness constraints (admissibility; non-deontic).**

* **WF‑MS‑1 (Membership set semantics).** `mechanisms` contains references to pairwise distinct mechanism intensions; field order carries no semantics.
* **WF‑MS‑2 (Protocol closure).** If `suite_protocols` is present, then for every `ProtocolStep` in every `SuiteProtocol`, `step.mechanism ∈ mechanisms`.
* **WF‑MS‑3 (Suite ≠ Pack).** `MechSuiteDescription` does not carry shipping/publication payloads; use the applicable shipping or publication pattern for those results.
* **WF‑MS‑4 (Suite ≠ Mechanism).** `MechSuiteDescription` contains no `OperationAlgebra`/`LawSet`/execution semantics and is not admissible where a `U.Mechanism.*` node is required.

* **Membership is by mechanism intension (order-free).**
  `mechanisms` MUST denote a duplicates-free set of distinct `U.Mechanism.Intension` members. Membership order has no semantics; any intended ordering is expressed only in `suite_protocols`. A suite is defined by declared mechanism intensions and suite protocols.

* **No substitution by `MechFamilyDescription`.**
  A suite MUST NOT be encoded as a `MechFamilyDescription`.
  If desired, a suite MAY additionally **cite** `MechFamilyDescription` / `MechInstanceDescription` for particular members (e.g., “preferred realization for this context”), but such citations do not redefine membership.

* **No “Pack” meaning.**
  A suite MUST NOT be named or treated as a publication pack. `Pack` remains reserved for publication/shipping bundling (e.g., G.10).

* **No mechanism semantics in the suite.**
  A suite is a **Description**, not a mechanism: it does not define `OperationAlgebra` and does not absorb gate logic.

#### A.6.7:4.2 SuiteObligations (canonical obligation vocabulary)

`MechSuiteDescription` MAY declare any obligations. The canonical names in §4.1 support reuse across Part G and admissibility-gated characterization stacks; they are not an exhaustive inventory.

`SuiteObligations` SHOULD be written as an explicit, duplicates-free clause set. Select applicable clauses from the canonical vocabulary in §4.1 and state any additional obligations explicitly. The requirements below remain applicable under their stated conditions.

**Obligation meanings (normative).**

1. **`bridge_only_crossings`.**
   Well-formedness constraint: cross-context and cross-plane reuse performed by any member mechanism is represented via that member’s published `Transport` as Bridge-only (no implicit crossings). A suite does not create transport exceptions.

   1.1. **`two_bridge_rule_for_described_entity_change`.**

   * If a suite member's admissible use requires changing the EntityOfConcern (kind or identity change, `CL^k`), the crossing MUST be explicit and MUST satisfy the two-bridge rule: plane transfer or context transfer and kind transfer are distinct, both are Bridge-mediated, and both remain penalty-routed to `R/R_eff` only.

   1.2. **`transport_declarative_only`.**
   * Well-formedness constraint: suite obligations do not introduce any additional graph edge kind beyond E.18 `U.Transfer` and do not embed CL/Φ/Ψ/Φ_plane tables. Any transport-related obligation is expressed only as referenced pins/anchors whose realization is mediated by E.18 / gate surfaces.

2. **`penalties_route_to_r_eff_only`.**
   Well-formedness constraint: CL/Φ/Ψ/Φ_plane penalties associated with crossing discipline route to `R/R_eff` only; suites do not define transport penalties that alter `F/G`.

3. **`guard_decision_tristate(pass|degrade|abstain)` and `unknown_never_coerces_to_pass`.**
   Well-formedness constraint: admissibility/eligibility outcomes use a tri-state guard result `GuardDecision := {pass|degrade|abstain}`. Unknown/insufficient evidence is not coerced to `pass`; it resolves to `{degrade|abstain}` under declared failure behavior (e.g., probe-only as a SoS‑LOG branch id, not as a new decision value).

4. **`gate_decision_separation`.**
   Well-formedness constraint: suites do not define or use `GateDecision` values (including `block`) as part of mechanism/suite semantics. Gate-level outcomes and `DecisionLog` remain on `OperationalGate(profile)`.

5. **`guard_lexeme_reservations`.**
   Well-formedness constraint: `USM.CompareGuard` and `USM.LaunchGuard` denote gate-owned guard events/pins; member mechanisms and suite protocols use `…Admissibility` / `…Eligibility` for guard predicates, not the reserved gate lexemes.

6. **`cg_spec_cite_required_for_numeric_ops`.**
   Well-formedness constraint: any member operation that performs numeric comparison/aggregation/admissibility-sensitive scoring cites the applicable `CG-Spec` (and relevant subrefs) as spec pins, rather than embedding equivalent local admissibility content.

7. **`no_silent_scalarisation_of_partial_orders` and `no_silent_totalisation`.**
   Well-formedness constraint: if a member mechanism induces a partial order, it preserves set-/relation-valued semantics; it does not silently reduce to a scalar/total order. Any totalization is explicit and policy-bound.

8. **`no_thresholds_in_suite_core`.**
   Well-formedness constraint: suite core does not publish acceptance thresholds (“passing scores” / hidden cutoffs). Thresholds belong to acceptance clauses / task signatures / gate profiles.

9. **`crossing_visibility_required`.**
   Well-formedness constraint: any GateCrossing relevant to suite use publishes a `CrossingBundle` (E.18) and can be cited as an audit anchor.
   GateCrossing includes (at minimum) cross-context, cross-plane, and cross-kind/EntityOfConcern changes, entry into `U.WorkEnactment` (LaunchGate), and any `edition_key` change of pinned `editions{…}` vectors.
   Suites may require `CrossingBundleRef` / UTS / Path pins and policy-id pins as anchors, and MUST NOT embed CL/Φ/Ψ/Φ_plane tables.

10. **`planned_slot_filling_in_work_planning_only`.**
    Well-formedness constraint: any planned slot filling used as a baseline for suite use is authored in `WorkPlanning` as a planned baseline (no run-time slot instances; no launch values).

11. **`finalize_launch_values_in_work_enactment_only`.**
   Well-formedness constraint: `FinalizeLaunchValues` (and any witness of actual launch values) occurs only in `U.WorkEnactment`; neither the suite nor any planned-baseline WorkPlanning plan item is a place for launch values.

#### A.6.7:4.3 SuiteSpecPins

A `MechSuiteDescription` MUST be able to declare required spec pins as references, not as duplicated content. Canonically:

```
SuiteSpecPins := ⟨
  required_spec_refs?: {CNSpecRef?, CGSpecRef?, ...},
  required_edition_pins?: EditionPin[*],
  required_policy_id_pins?: PolicyIdPin[*],
  required_planned_baseline_ref?: PlannedBaselineRef?
⟩
```

**Norms.**

* If the suite is admissibility-gated for characterization, `CNSpecRef` and `CGSpecRef` MUST be required (as references/pins).
* Spec pins are citations and anchors. They do not replace the underlying `…Spec` objects.
* A suite MAY require the presence of a planned-baseline WorkPlanning plan item in P2W (e.g., a WorkPlanning plan item such as `…SlotFillingsPlanItem` that pins chosen refs/editions), but MUST treat it as a **reference/pin requirement**, not as a place to store launch values or gate decisions.
  When required, the planned-baseline WorkPlanning plan item is authored in `WorkPlanning` and is citeable by downstream `U.Work.Audit`; any `FinalizeLaunchValues` witness remains `U.WorkEnactment`-only.
* A suite MAY be referenced by `TargetSlotOwnerRef` for a planned-baseline plan item: the Description-level ref names the description whose `SlotKind` set is being filled. This does not make the suite a mechanism and does not create run-time slot instances.

#### A.6.7:4.4 SuiteProtocols

A suite MAY describe allowed protocols (pipelines) as descriptive constraints on how suite members are intended to be composed. A `SuiteProtocol` describes the member-operation sequence. Its description:

* MUST name the member mechanisms it uses (explicitly; no “implicit use”),
* MAY mark steps as optional,
* MUST NOT introduce hidden crossings or hidden admissibility steps,
* MUST identify any “publish/telemetry” as an external step of the surrounding protocol, realized through existing publication surfaces (e.g., Part G shipping), rather than as a hidden tail inside a mechanism. This external step is not a `ProtocolStep` in the suite-member sequence.

A canonical shape for the suite-member sequence:

```
SuiteProtocol := ⟨
  steps: [ ProtocolStep₁, …, ProtocolStepₙ ],
  invariants?: ProtocolInvariant[*],
  notes?: DidacticNotes
⟩

ProtocolStep := ⟨
  mechanism: U.Mechanism.IntensionRef,
  operation: OperationName,
  optionality: {required|optional},
  requires_pins?: PinRef[*]
⟩
```

#### A.6.7:4.5 SuiteAuditObligations

A suite MAY require that downstream use provide certain audit anchors. These are **requirements**, not run-time values. A suite audit obligation MAY include:

* required `UTS` + `Path` pins,
* required crossing-surface visibility pins for any crossing relevant to suite use,
* required presence of `USM.CompareGuard` and/or `USM.LaunchGuard` **pins** (not gate checks),
* required declaration of guard ownership (e.g., a `GuardOwnerGateSlot` anchor),
* required expression of guard violations as `GuardFail` events aggregated by the guard-owning gate (per `GuardOwnerGateSlot`), not as extra mechanism/suite states,
* required policy-id pins for any degrade/sandbox/probe-only branches (SoS‑LOG branch id anchors).
* required parity/selection-grade pins when applicable (e.g., when suite use claims parity-grade comparison/selection surfaces downstream).

**Norm.** A suite must never publish a `DecisionLog` or `GateDecision`. If the suite requires guard pins, it requires their **presence** as anchors so that the gate-level owner can aggregate `GuardFail`s and decide `degrade|block` per gate profile.

#### A.6.7:4.6 Examples

**Example 1 (membership-and-ordering illustration).** A characterization admissibility suite. This compact form illustrates membership and ordering; a conformance demonstration must also supply the member/operation bindings and the other applicable required values.

```
CHRMechanismSuiteDescription : MechSuiteDescription :=
  mech_suite_id = CHRMechanismSuiteId
  mechanisms = { UNM, UINDM, USCM, ULSAM, CPM, SelectorMechanism }
  suite_obligations includes:
    bridge_only_crossings,
    penalties_route_to_r_eff_only,
    guard_decision_tristate(pass|degrade|abstain),
    gate_decision_separation,
    cg_spec_cite_required_for_numeric_ops,
    no_silent_scalarisation_of_partial_orders,
    crossing_visibility_required,
    planned_slot_filling_in_work_planning_only,
    finalize_launch_values_in_work_enactment_only
  suite_spec_pins requires: {CNSpecRef, CGSpecRef}
  suite_protocols includes:
    normalize → indicatorize → score → (fold_Γ?) → compare → select
```

The surrounding protocol continues with external `publish/telemetry` after `select`, through the applicable publication surface.

This description is not a `MechFamilyDescription` (because it contains multiple distinct mechanisms), and it is not a `Pack` (because it does not ship publications; it only declares membership and shared obligations/pins/protocols).

**Example 2 (non-conformant).** Misusing a family as a suite:

```
CHRMechanismFamily : MechFamilyDescription := { UNM, UINDM, USCM, ... }
```

This is a level error: `MechFamilyDescription` is reserved for realizations of a single mechanism intension.

**Example 3 (non-conformant).** Turning a suite into a hidden gate:

* The suite declares `GateDecision` values or embeds a `DecisionLog`.
* The suite defines acceptance thresholds (“pass score ≥ 0.7”) as part of suite obligations.
* The suite embeds Φ/CL tables or invents an additional graph edge kind beyond E.18 `U.Transfer`.

All violate the separation between mechanism/suite descriptions and gate-level operational control.

### A.6.7:5 - Archetypal Grounding

A suite is an archetypal mechanism-suite “passport”:

* It answers **what mechanisms exist in the bundle** and **what shared invariants** make their composition lawful.
* It provides **shared governing spec anchors** (pins) that downstream planning and work must cite.
* It remains descriptive: it does not contain run-time outputs, and it does not replace the transformation-flow structure selected under E.18 for composition and crossing visibility.

### A.6.7:6 - Bias-Annotation

Common biases this pattern guards against:

* **Overloading “family”.** Treating “many different mechanisms” as “many realizations of one mechanism” destroys level hygiene and encourages semantic drift across members.
* **Publication conflation.** Using “pack” semantics to smuggle publication/shipping obligations into the meaning of a mechanism bundle.
* **Gate conflation.** Treating suite-level obligations as gate decisions (“block”) instead of keeping `block` at the gate layer.
* **Convenience totalization.** Collapsing partial orders into scalars “for ease of selection”, which undermines set-return semantics and admissibility gating.

### A.6.7:7 - Conformance Checklist

A `MechSuiteDescription` is conformant iff all applicable items hold:

**CC‑A.6.7‑1 (Correct level).** The suite’s `mechanisms` enumerate **distinct** `U.Mechanism.Intension` members. The suite is not encoded as `MechFamilyDescription`.

**CC‑A.6.7‑2 (Description token, not `U.*`).** The suite token is a Description token and MUST NOT be introduced under `U.*`. Its name ends with `…Description`.

**CC‑A.6.7‑3 (No execution semantics).** The suite MUST NOT define mechanism blocks (`OperationAlgebra`, `LawSet`, etc.) and MUST NOT be used as a mechanism node.

**CC‑A.6.7‑4 (No gate decisions).** The suite MUST NOT define `GateDecision`, MUST NOT publish `DecisionLog`, and MUST preserve gate/mechanism separation.

**CC‑A.6.7‑5 (Spec pins, not duplication).** If the suite is admissibility-gated for numeric comparison/aggregation/scoring, it MUST require `CG-Spec` citation pins (and SHOULD require `CN-Spec` pins where applicable). It MUST NOT duplicate spec content as “local CG-Spec”.

**CC‑A.6.7‑5a (CN+CG pins for admissibility-gated characterization).** If the suite is admissibility-gated for characterization, it MUST require both `CNSpecRef` and `CGSpecRef` as pins (references), consistent with A.6.7:4.3.

**CC‑A.6.7‑6 (Transport discipline preserved).** The suite MUST NOT introduce transport exceptions. Any crossing obligations must remain Bridge-only and must route penalties to `R/R_eff` only.

**CC‑A.6.7‑7 (Tri-state guard discipline when used).** If the suite declares admissibility/eligibility semantics, it MUST use `GuardDecision := {pass|degrade|abstain}` and MUST NOT coerce unknown to pass.

**CC‑A.6.7‑8 (No thresholds in core).** The suite MUST NOT publish acceptance thresholds or “passing scores”. Thresholds must remain in acceptance clauses / task signatures / gate profiles.

**CC‑A.6.7‑9 (Crossing visibility anchors).** If suite use depends on crossings (context or plane/kind, entry into `U.WorkEnactment` (LaunchGate), or edition-key changes), the suite MUST require crossing visibility anchors (BridgeId/channel, ReferencePlane, CL mode, policy-id pins, UTS/Path pins) as audit obligations, without embedding the tables.

**CC‑A.6.7‑10 (Suite id present).** The suite MUST declare `mech_suite_id: MechSuiteId` so that downstream planning/audit can cite it stably.

**CC‑A.6.7‑11 (Two-bridge discipline preserved).** If suite obligations claim cross-kind/EntityOfConcern validity, they MUST require explicit `CL^k` handling (two-bridge rule) and MUST NOT allow implicit EntityOfConcern changes.

**CC‑A.6.7‑12 (Implementation export hygiene when cited).** If the suite cites realizations/implementations, the citations MUST preserve export/import discipline (LOG/CHR: no Γ export; CAL: exactly one Γ; imports acyclic).

**CC‑A.6.7‑13 (No Pack conflation).** The suite MUST NOT be introduced, named, or used as a publication/shipping `Pack`.

**CC‑A.6.7‑14 (Protocol closure & explicitness).** If `suite_protocols` is present, every `ProtocolStep.mechanism` MUST be a member of `mechanisms` (WF‑MS‑2) and the protocol MUST NOT rely on implicit mechanism steps or implicit crossings.

**CC‑A.6.7‑15 (P2W split preserved when applicable).** If the suite requires a planned-baseline pin, that baseline MUST be a `WorkPlanning` plan item and MUST NOT contain launch values or `FinalizeLaunchValues` witnesses; such witnesses remain `U.WorkEnactment`-only.

### A.6.7:8 - Common Anti-Patterns and How to Avoid Them

1. **Anti-pattern: “Family-as-suite”.**
   Using `MechFamilyDescription` to list multiple distinct mechanisms.
   **Fix:** use `MechSuiteDescription` for “many mechanisms”, and keep `MechFamilyDescription` for “many realizations of one mechanism”.

2. **Anti-pattern: “Pack-as-suite”.**
   Naming/using the suite as a `Pack`.
   **Fix:** reserve `Pack` for publication/shipping bundling; use `Suite` for mechanism bundles.

3. **Anti-pattern: “Suite contains admissibility tables”.**
   Duplicating CG‑Spec or embedding CL/Φ/Ψ tables in suite obligations.
   **Fix:** publish pins and references only; keep admissibility content in `...Spec` and policy registries; keep crossing realization in E.18/gate surfaces.

4. **Anti-pattern: “Suite is a hidden gate”.**
   Introducing thresholds, `block`, or `DecisionLog` in the suite.
   **Fix:** suite declares guard formats and required pins; the gate issues decisions.

5. **Anti-pattern: “Implicit calls”.**
   A protocol implies “normalize happens somewhere” without explicit member and pin visibility.
   **Fix:** protocols enumerate steps and required pins; E.18 `Uses` edges remain explicit.

### A.6.7:9 - Consequences

**Benefits.**

* Eliminates level confusion between “family of realizations” vs “bundle of mechanisms”.
* Provides a Kernel governing pattern for universal obligations reused across multiple patterns (notably Part G universalization).
* Makes admissibility/transport/audit obligations shared and explicit, reducing semantic drift across member mechanisms.

**Costs.**

* Introduces an additional `MechSuiteDescription` publication that must be maintained as suites evolve.
* Requires discipline: suites must remain descriptive and must not become “meta-mechanisms” or “hidden gates”.

### A.6.7:10 - Rationale

Characterization and admissibility-gated selection pipelines are unified by:

* shared governing spec refs (e.g., CN‑Spec / CG‑Spec),
* shared transport and crossing discipline (Bridge-only; penalties to `R_eff`),
* shared guard semantics (tri-state, no coercion),
* and explicit protocol constraints (allowed pipelines).

Encoding this unity as “one mechanism” or “one family” forces false commonality and invites hidden semantics. A dedicated **suite descriptor** preserves modularity and keeps the level separation clean.

### A.6.7:11 - SoTA-Echoing

Separating **governing spec refs** from **operators**, declaring composition protocols, and keeping **decision procedures** distinct from **gating/acceptance control** make the requirements of each part visible.

Use this separation to describe multi-step evaluation pipelines, such as calibrated scoring, uncertainty-aware comparison, Pareto / selected-set selection, and quality-diversity archives. `MechSuiteDescription` describes their shared obligations while keeping domain methods and FPF pattern generators outside the universal core.

### A.6.7:12 - Relations

* **Relates to A.6.1:** suite members are `U.Mechanism.Intension`; the suite does not replace the mechanism definition.
* **Relates to A.6.5:** member operation declarations retain A.6.1 argument/result meanings, ValueKinds and binding rules. A.6.5 applies only where a cited `RelationSignature` independently declares participant SlotSpecs; there SlotKind stability, correct refMode and non-semantic SlotIndex remain required.
* **Relates to E.18 / P2W:** suite protocols describe intended composition; use E.18 for the selected transformation-flow structure and its crossings, and E.18.1 for P2W carry-through.
* **Suite conformance:** Suite-level conformance uses the conceptual checklist in §7; suites require pins/anchors rather than procedural validation.
* **Relates to G.10:** suites are not packs; G.10 handles shipping of Part-G outputs as a SoTA pack, while E.17 publishes reader-facing forms of an already accepted engineering account.

### A.6.7:End
