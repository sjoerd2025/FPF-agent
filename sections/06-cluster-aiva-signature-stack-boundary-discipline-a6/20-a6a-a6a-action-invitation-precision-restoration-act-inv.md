## A.6.A - Action-Invitation Precision Restoration (ACT-INV)

> **Type:** Architectural (A)
> **Status:** Stable
> **Normativity:** Normative (Core)

**Plain-name.** Affordance and action-invitation precision restoration.

**Use this pattern when** affordance-like or action-first wording hides a site, invited enactor, candidate action, coupling frame, detector or viewpoint, normal form, admissible use, or subject-pattern boundary.

**What goes wrong if missed.** An invitation becomes a duty, capability, work occurrence, gate, policy, or evidence claim; the project then acts on “actionable” wording without knowing who is invited to do what, where, and under which relation.

**What this buys.** The phrase becomes an explicit `actionInvitation(...)` relation with sense family, site, invited enactor, candidate action, normal form, articulation state, admissible downstream use, and neighboring-pattern boundary.

**First useful move.** Rewrite the trigger as one `actionInvitation(...)` with exact site, invited enactor, candidate action, sense, coupling frame and normal form. If the candidate action is enactment, name its exact `methodRef -> U.Method` first and keep any `methodDescriptionRef` auxiliary. If viewpoint use matters, resolve `viewpointRef` under the effective reference scheme; include `view` only after its independent E.17.0 conformance is already established.

**Not this pattern when.** If the current claim is already primarily about a Method, MethodDescription, WorkPlan, actual Work, capability, duty, gate, evidence, evaluation or publication, use that subject pattern. Keep A.6.A only when a preceding invitation relation itself remains useful; its record never substitutes for the downstream object.

**E.24.UK settlement.** A.6.A does not admit `U.ActionInvitationPrecisionRestoration` as a durable U-kind. The pattern defines or constrains action-invitation precision restoration for affordance-like and action-first wording. The durable values it may recover are the explicit `actionInvitation(...)` relation, its sense family, normal form, candidate action, site, would-be enactor, and neighboring method, work, capability, commitment, evidence, gate, or publication values when those claims are current.

**Intent.**
Provide a reusable discipline for repairing overloaded **affordance-like and action-first** language in FPF texts.

This pattern is an **A.6.P RPR specialisation** for **post-threshold** action-oriented content: it turns bare action-oriented prose into one explicit, slot-explicit **action invitation** relation family with a declared **sense family**, admissible **normal forms** (`CuePack | ActionOption | OptionSet | PolicyHook`), explicit **change semantics**, and lexical guardrails.
Pre-threshold action-guiding cue content remains with `A.16.1` or `B.4.1` until the cue is articulated enough for `actionInvitation(...)` publication.
It does **not** mint a parallel execution ontology: when a candidate action is invited enactment, it selects an exact independently admitted `U.Method`; any current `methodDescriptionRef` is a separate C.2.1 episteme used to identify, constrain or justify that Method or intended Work. Intended Work remains a `U.WorkPlan`, and actual enactment remains dated `U.Work` with exact `enactsMethod` under **A.15**. The invitation, Method, MethodDescription, plan and Work never become one action kind by prose.

It allows ecological-psychology, phenomenological, active-inference, control-theoretic, interface, engineering-operations, and robotics uses to coexist **without false identity by label**.

**Placement.**
Part A > cluster **A.6 Signature Stack & Boundary Discipline** > specialisation of **A.6.P** for under-specified affordance-like and action-first language.

**Builds on.**
A.3, A.6, A.6.B, A.6.P, A.6.RSIR, A.6.S, A.6.0, A.6.5, A.2.6, A.7, A.15, E.8, E.10, F.9, F.18.

**Coordinates with.**
**C.16.Q** for evaluative-language repair; **C.2.2a, A.16, A.16.1, A.16.2, and B.4.1** for language-state chart positions, articulation and closure coordination, admissible moves, early cue classification, next-use docking, and admissible retreat when a published invitation must be reopened; use **A.16.0** only when lineage, branch, loss, or an actual responsibility-handoff history itself must be published as an explicit trajectory account; **B.5.2.0** when the admissible continuation is still an open probe question rather than an invitation; **C.2.LS, C.2.4, C.2.5, C.2.6, and C.2.7** for articulation, closure, anchoring, and representation-factor facets referenced but not governed here; **A.10** and **B.3** for evidence and assurance; **B.4** and **B.5** for anomaly-driven cycles; **E.17.0**, **E.17**, and **E.18** for viewpoint reference resolution, independent view conformance, and viewpoint publication; **F.9** for Bridges and bounded-use claims; **F.9.1** for optional stance notes about those claims; **C.3.3** for kind-bridge repair when endpoint kind mismatches appear.

**E.10.ARCH relation.**
A.6.A is the precision-restoration realization pattern for action-invitation wording only. Apply A.6.A when an `E.10` or `E.10.ARCH` repair has recovered an action-invitation case and the action-first language still hides a site, invited enactor, candidate action, coupling frame, detector or viewpoint, normal form, admissible use, or subject-pattern boundary after quality, capability, deontic, work, evidence, assurance, gate, decision, publication, state-family, architecture, function-like, and relation-only cases have been excluded or governed by the patterns for the recovered claims. If the repaired phrase is primarily evaluative, use `C.16.Q`; if it is primarily capability, method, work, duty, evidence, assurance, gate, or decision, use the subject pattern and keep A.6.A only as an optional preceding invitation record when the invitation semantics remain live.

**Non-goal.**
This pattern does **not** assert that physical affordances, interface affordances, social affordances, epistemic probe moves, articulation-closure moves, latent policy cues, and control opportunities are one concept.

Its job is to publish a disciplined treatment of action-first language across those traditions, using a direct contrast when that is enough and an F.9 Bridge only for an exact cross-context semantic-correspondence claim, while preventing false identity by shared language.

It also does **not** assert that every trigger use of action-first language is admissibly repaired by `actionInvitation(...)`:

* where the repaired statement is primarily **evaluative**, use **C.16.Q**;
* where it is primarily about **general capability**, capability wording, method wording, or method-description wording, use **A.6.F**, `U.Capability`, `U.Method`, or `MethodDescription` according to the claim being made;
* where it is primarily **deontic**, apply **A.6.B**;
* where it is primarily about **scheduled or executed enactment**, use the governing **A.15** pattern family: exact `U.Method`, separate `U.MethodDescription`, intended `U.WorkPlan`, and actual `U.Work` with exact `enactsMethod` once execution has occurred. Keep `actionInvitation(...)` only as a preceding invitation when that relation is still current, never as a shadow execution model.

### A.6.A:1 - Problem frame

FPF repeatedly encounters a predictable precision failure mode around **affordance-like and action-first** language.

Authors say:

* “this handle affords pulling”
* “the interface invites confirmation”
* “the alarm calls for rollback”
* “this discrepancy suggests probing deeper”
* “the draft is ready for formalization”
* “the model wants to brake”
* “the situation is actionable”

…but the intended meaning is actually one of several different **action-oriented families**, for example:

1. **Physical affordance** — a physical or environmental configuration offers a bodily action to an embodied agent.
2. **Interface affordance** — an operator-interface element, operator panel, alarm, or publication face presents an operator move.
3. **Social affordance** — another agent or interactional setting invites a response or coordination move.
4. **Epistemic probe move** — a problem situation invites asking, comparing, measuring, testing, or instrumenting.
5. **Closure-advance move** — a situation invites naming, rescoping, proxy declaration, or formalization.
6. **Latent policy cue** — a learned or distributed state carries an action-oriented tendency not yet locally articulated.
7. **Control opportunity** — a closed-loop state invites braking, rollback, replan, isolate, escalate, or override.

The recurrent failure modes are:

* **Site confusion.** The invitation-bearing site is unclear: physical entity, scene, interface entity, description episteme, carrier, policy state, or problem episode.
* **Enactor confusion.** It is unclear **which `U.System`, collective system, or role assignment whose holder is a `U.System`** is invited to act: human operator, robot controller, research team, review service, or named automation system.
* **Action confusion.** The candidate action is hidden behind vague language like *actionable*, *calls for*, *ready for*, *natural next step*.
* **Invitation vs obligation collapse.** A situation that merely invites an action is rewritten as if it already created a duty.
* **Invitation vs capability collapse.** A local, situated action opportunity is rewritten as if it were a general capability claim.
* **Invitation vs work collapse.** Offered action is narrated as if it had already been executed.
* **Substrate confusion.** Ecological, embodied, latent-distributed, and symbolic-local action cues are silently collapsed.
* **Bridge illusion.** Similar language across traditions is mistaken for sameness.
* **Premature closure.** An early cue is published as if it were already a committed method, gate, or policy.

### A.6.A:2 - Problem

How can FPF let authors use the communicative convenience of **affordance-like and action-first** language while preventing category errors when the language crosses:

* ecological and phenomenological discourse,
* interface and operator-facing discourse,
* active-inference and world-model discourse,
* control, monitoring, and incident-response discourse,
* robotics and embodied-AI discourse,
* epistemic exploration and problem-framing discourse?

### A.6.A:3 - Forces

* **Action speed vs auditability.** Action-first language is attractive because it is fast; that same speed makes it unsafe at boundaries.
* **Situated coupling vs explicit publication.** Affordances arise in agent–environment or policy–world coupling, but boundary use requires explicit local publication.
* **Preconceptual cue vs later articulation.** Some invitations are real before they are stably worded.
* **Enactor specificity vs shared discourse.** A cue may be visible to one detector yet relevant to another would-be enactor.
* **Opportunity vs obligation.** Not every invitation is a gate or commitment.
* **Option plurality vs premature scalarisation.** Several candidate actions may co-exist without an admissible total ordering.
* **Cross-tradition dialogue vs false unification.** The framework should preserve parallels without asserting identity.
* **Progressive closure.** An action cue may later become an option, then a policy hook, and only later a formal gate or work plan.

### A.6.A:4 - Solution - Stable lens -> Sense Family -> Slots -> Normal Form -> Change Lexicon -> Guardrails

#### A.6.A:4.0 - Trigger rule

A use of affordance-like or action-first language is in scope for A.6.A when any of the following holds:

* the prose uses tokens such as **affords**, **invites**, **calls for**, **actionable**, **ready for**, **ripe for**, **natural next step**, **the model wants**, **the interface tells**, **this problem asks for**;
* a boundary, gate, incident note, design note, or review note uses such language for admission, selection, triage, or action guidance;
* different traditions are compared using the same action-first wording;
* a draft introduces *model affordance*, *interface affordance*, *actionable insight*, *policy invitation*, or *ready for formalization* without declared sense;
* the author intends the phrase to carry more than one of: situational action opportunity, latent cue, operator move, probe move, closure move, or control move.

#### A.6.A:4.0a - Operational repair sequence

When the trigger fires, authors SHOULD follow the A.6.P repair sequence:

1. **Capture the trigger span.**
   Copy the trigger phrase.

2. **Reconstruct the candidate set.**
   Enumerate plausible candidate interpretations, including:

   * candidate **relation families** (`actionInvitation` vs `evaluativeAscription` vs capability claim vs commitment vs work occurrence),
   * candidate **site classification over the EntityOfConcern and Description-episteme boundary**, with publication or carrier participation stated separately when live,
   * candidate **would-be enactor classifications**,
   * candidate **action tuples**.

   If the occurrence is decision-bearing or publication-bearing, record a short **Candidate-Set Note** before selecting a repair.

3. **Select one explicit action-invitation sense.**
   Pick one `ActionInvitationSense` token and state why rivals were rejected in this local context.

4. **Emit a slot-explicit rewrite.**
   Rewrite the sentence into one explicit `actionInvitation(...)` record with site, would-be enactor, candidate action, coupling frame, detector, `viewpointRef` and independent `view` when live, normal form, and qualifiers. Resolve any viewpoint reference under the effective reference scheme; record inclusion establishes no dependent-kind membership.

5. **Classify boundary-bearing consequences.**
   If the repaired statement is used for admissibility, commitments, publication, automation, or evidence-bearing decisions, classify the downstream claim uses with **A.6.B** and, where enactment is implied, through **A.15**, instead of letting the vague action-first phrase carry evidence, admissibility, gate, or decision consequences by itself.

#### A.6.A:4.1 - Post-threshold lens: action-invitation classification specified by `actionInvitation(...)`

A.6.A stabilises the ambiguity cluster by treating in-scope post-threshold affordance-like or action-first statements as **qualified action-oriented content that must publish an explicit action-invitation normal form and declared downstream classification**, not as bare adjectives or rhetorical verbs.
Early action-guiding cue content may remain in `A.16.1` or `B.4.1` as cue-pack content, a `RoutedCueSet`, or another typed cue-preserving upstream publication before A.6.A application.
`A.6.A` is therefore applied only once local `AE` is high enough to name site, enactor, and action structure explicitly and local `CD` is high enough that one invitation interpretation is worth publishing as a relation record rather than remaining cue-pack or unresolved cue content. If the admissible publication is still a cue pack, `RoutedCueSet`, or open abductive prompt, stay in `A.16.1`, `B.4.1`, or `B.5.2.0`.
If a published `actionInvitation(...)` later loses those minimal articulation and closure conditions, retreat via `A.16.2` rather than leaving a stale invitation record live.

In A.6.P terms, this pattern fixes one post-threshold relation family and one downstream classification discipline:
* **`actionInvitation`** — the explicit post-threshold relation kind for affordance, invitation, control-opportunity, probe-move, and closure-advance rewrites once the cue or content is articulated enough to publish a relation record.

#### A.6.A:4.1a - RelationKind specification skeleton for `actionInvitation`

The family-specific `RelationKind` token is **`actionInvitation`**.
Its relation specification publication SHALL declare, at minimum:

* **(L)** applicability in the local Context or plane set;
* **(L)** site-centred polarity: the relation is about a **site or situation** inviting a candidate action **for** an enactor; it SHALL NOT be silently rewritten as a monadic property of a site participant alone;
* **(L)** participant SlotSpecs for site, invited enactor, candidate action, sense, coupling frame, and normal-form positions;
* **(A)** repair options for site-kind and enactor-kind mismatches: explicit narrowing, `KindBridge`, `retargetSite(...)`, `retargetInvitedEnactor(...)`, or a stated combination of these repairs when several mismatch conditions are live;
* **(L)** qualifier expectations for `scope`, `Γ_time`, `viewpointRef`, `effectiveReferenceScheme`, independent `view`, `representationSubstrate`, `bridgeRef`, and (when relevant) `articulationHint`;
* **(D)** detector and invited-enactor separation discipline: the perceiver or detector SHALL NOT be silently collapsed into the invited enactor when they differ;
* **(D)** obligation barrier: invitation language SHALL NOT be silently rewritten as duty language;
* **(A/E)** witness discipline for decision use, publication use, and automation use;
* **(L/A)** admissible semantic change classes and edition-fence expectations;
* **(A/E)** cross-context and cross-plane policy when reuse is claimed.

Each in-scope occurrence SHALL be representable as a pattern-specific **QualifiedRelationRecord**:

`ActionInvitationRecord :=`
`⟨`
`  relationKind             : actionInvitation,`
`  siteTuple                : …,`
`  siteClassification?      : tuple-member -> EntityOfConcern ref, Description episteme ref, or non-claim-bearing site kind,`
`  publicationOrCarrierParticipation? : publication face, publication form, carrier, rendering, or none,`
`  invitedEnactorTuple      : …,`
`  candidateActionTuple     : …,`
`  actionInvitationSense    : ActionInvitationSense,`
`  couplingFrame            : …,`
`  detector?                : …,`
`  viewpointRef?            : U.ViewpointRef,`
`  effectiveReferenceScheme?: U.ReferenceScheme,`
`  view?                    : U.View,`
`  normalForm               : CuePack | ActionOption | OptionSet | PolicyHook,`
`  articulationHint?        : open-cue | sketched | option-explicit | hook-explicit,`
`  scope?                   : U.Scope,`
`  Γ_time?                  : GammaTimePolicy,`
`  representationSubstrate? : ecological-world-coupled | embodied-kinesthetic | latent-distributed | symbolic-local | hybrid,`
`  bridgeRef?               : BridgeId,`
`  witnesses?               : EvidenceRefSet`
`⟩`

**Viewpoint and view discipline.**
When `viewpointRef` is present, `effectiveReferenceScheme` is also explicit and the reference resolves under that scheme to one exact independently admitted `U.Viewpoint` episteme. `view` is a separate optional value: it names one independently identified C.2.1 episteme that already has `U.View` membership only because exact E.17.0 `EpistemeViewpointConformanceRelation(view, viewpoint)` obtains for at least one admitted viewpoint. The selected `viewpointRef` need not be the viewpoint to which an optional view conforms unless the record explicitly claims that relation. Including `viewpointRef` or `view` in `ActionInvitationRecord` establishes neither `U.Viewpoint` nor `U.View` dependent-kind membership; it only cites already established objects. Detector, viewpoint selection, view membership, viewing construction and publication remain separate.

So the sentence “X affords Y” is never accepted as a terminal form.
Within the scope of A.6.A it must be rewritten into an explicit `actionInvitation(...)` instance with declared downstream subject pattern or publication; earlier pre-threshold cue content may instead remain as cue-pack content, a `RoutedCueSet`, or another typed cue-preserving upstream publication before A.6.A application.

**Discipline note.**
`ActionInvitationSense` is a **slot value inside** the relation family; it is not a replacement for the relation family itself.
The stable intermediate lens is the `actionInvitation(...)` relation; the sense token refines **what kind of invitation** is being published.

**P2W relation note.**
`candidateActionTuple` names the invited move as relation content. It is not an actual `U.Work` occurrence and not a `U.WorkPlan`. When that move is invited enactment, the tuple SHALL select one exact independently admitted Method as `methodRef -> U.Method`; an optional `methodDescriptionRef` cites a separate C.2.1 episteme used only to identify, constrain or justify that Method or intended Work. Selecting the Method makes the invited action inspectable but does not schedule or perform it. When the publication needs intended Work, actual Work, work result or result measurement, use `A.15`, `A.15.1`, or `A.15.2` instead of stretching `actionInvitation(...)`; actual Work enacts the Method, never the description.

**A.7 boundary note.**
`siteClassification` uses the EntityOfConcern and Description-episteme boundary: the site member is either an EntityOfConcern-side participant, a Description episteme participant, or a non-claim-bearing site kind named directly.
If a publication face, publication form, interop publication form, carrier, or rendering participates, declare it in `publicationOrCarrierParticipation` under A.7 and publication-face and publication-form discipline rather than widening the site classification with a generic quoted `Surface` token.

**Separation note.**
`detector` and `invitedEnactor` are not synonyms.
When both matter, they SHALL be published separately.

**Enactor note.**
When `invitedEnactorTuple` is published as an actual would-be enactor, it SHALL resolve to a `U.System` or to a role assignment whose holder is a `U.System`. An episteme, description, publication face, or carrier may participate in the **site**, but not as the acting bearer.

**Episteme non-agency note.**
If the site is a Description episteme, any later enactment still occurs through carriers, acted-on systems, or both; the description itself never acts.

#### A.6.A:4.2 - Core construct: `ActionInvitationSense`

Every in-scope use SHALL resolve to an explicit **`ActionInvitationSense`** token.

An `ActionInvitationSense` token publishes at least:

`ActionInvitationSense :=`
`⟨`
`  senseId,`
`  siteArity,`
`  enactorArity,`
`  candidateActionArity,`
`  defaultArticulationHint,`
`  admissibleArticulationHints,`
`  defaultRepresentationSubstrate,`
`  admissibleRepresentationSubstrates,`
`  defaultNormalForm,`
`  admissibleNormalForms,`
`  couplingFrameKind,`
`  admissibleEvidenceModes,`
`  admissibleChangeClasses,`
`  bridgePolicy`
`⟩`

Where:

* **`defaultArticulationHint`** and **`admissibleArticulationHints`** use the current local articulation-token set
  `{ open-cue, sketched, option-explicit, hook-explicit }`
* **`defaultRepresentationSubstrate`** ∈
  `{ ecological-world-coupled, embodied-kinesthetic, latent-distributed, symbolic-local, hybrid }`
* **`admissibleRepresentationSubstrates`** explicitly declares the admissible publication substrates for the sense;
* **`defaultNormalForm`** ∈
  `{ CuePack, ActionOption, OptionSet, PolicyHook }`

#### A.6.A:4.2a - A.16 articulation-token relation note

A.6.A carries `articulationHint` only as a **local articulation-cue field**.

This field is deliberately **not** a new formality progression, **not** a maturity scale, and **not** a surrogate for **F**. Its only job is to preserve local articulation and closure cues until they can be related to `A.16` move logic and the explicit `C.2.4` and `C.2.5` governing facets.

Local `articulationHint` tokens SHALL be related to `A.16` move logic and to the explicit `C.2.4` and `C.2.5` governing facets one-for-one, and A.6.A SHALL treat them as local publication cues only.
Until then, local hints SHALL NOT be thresholded, aggregated, or compared across Contexts.

#### A.6.A:4.3 - Normative starter set of sense families
A Context MAY add local senses, but the following starter set is normative as the initial disambiguation menu:

| `ActionInvitationSense` token | Use when the action-first phrase means…                                                     |            Default normal form | Typical substrate                                    | Must **not** be silently collapsed into                  |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -----------------------------: | ---------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `AIS.PhysicalAffordance`      | a physical or environmental configuration offers a bodily action to an embodied agent       |    `CuePack` or `ActionOption` | `ecological-world-coupled` or `embodied-kinesthetic` | site-participant property alone, generic capability, executed work |
| `AIS.InterfaceAffordance`     | an operator-interface element, operator panel, alarm, or publication face presents an operator move | `ActionOption` or `PolicyHook` | `symbolic-local` or `hybrid`                         | duty or commitment, execution log                           |
| `AIS.SocialAffordance`        | another agent or social situation invites a response or coordination move                   |    `CuePack` or `ActionOption` | `embodied-kinesthetic` or `hybrid`                   | role assignment itself, deontic commitment               |
| `AIS.EpistemicProbe`          | a problem situation invites asking, contrasting, measuring, testing, or instrumenting       |  `ActionOption` or `OptionSet` | `hybrid`                                             | explanatory merit, evidence claim, finished method       |
| `AIS.ClosureAdvance`          | a situation invites naming, rescoping, proxy declaration, or formalization toward closure   |                 `ActionOption` | `symbolic-local` or `hybrid`                         | Formality **F**, acceptance status, quality ascription   |
| `AIS.LatentPolicyCue`         | a learned or distributed state carries an action-oriented tendency not yet locally articulated |       `CuePack` or `OptionSet` | `latent-distributed` or `hybrid`                     | explicit rationale, control adequacy, quality claim      |
| `AIS.ControlOpportunity`      | a closed-loop state invites braking, rollback, replanning, isolation, escalation, or override |    `OptionSet` or `PolicyHook` | `hybrid`                                             | bare “model wants”, obligation, work occurrence          |

**Normative rewrite note.**

* In **ecological and embodied** contexts, bare *affords* SHALL rewrite to **`AIS.PhysicalAffordance`** unless another sense is explicitly declared.
* In **operator-interface, alarm, or operator-panel** contexts, bare action-first phrasing SHALL rewrite to **`AIS.InterfaceAffordance`**, **`AIS.ControlOpportunity`**, or both when both senses are live. If the wording instead claims module interface, functional port, API, protocol, signature, interface specification, or service-access compatibility, use `A.6.RSIR`, `A.6.M`, `A.6.F`, or `A.6.0` according to the recovered EoC rather than treating the cue as an action invitation.
* In **epistemic exploration** contexts, "this suggests probing, formalizing, or reframing" SHALL rewrite to **`AIS.EpistemicProbe`**, **`AIS.ClosureAdvance`**, or both when both senses are live.
* In **learned world-model, active-inference, or policy** contexts, bare "the model wants" or "the state suggests" SHALL rewrite to **`AIS.LatentPolicyCue`**, **`AIS.ControlOpportunity`**, or both when both senses are live, with the distinction made explicit.
* If the sentence is chiefly about **better, worse, fit, or merit**, use **C.16.Q** instead of A.6.A.

#### A.6.A:4.4 - Required slots for a conforming `actionInvitation`

A conforming `actionInvitation` SHALL make explicit:

1. **Site tuple and site classification.**
   Site tuple members: named EntityOfConcern, scene, interface element or front-end element, Description episteme, episode, control state, or non-claim-bearing site kind - with publication or carrier participation stated separately when live.

2. **Invited enactor tuple.**
   Which `U.System`, collective system, or role assignment whose holder is a `U.System` is invited to act.

3. **Candidate action tuple.**
   What action is being invited. If it is enactment, the tuple names exact `methodRef -> U.Method`; any `methodDescriptionRef` remains a separate auxiliary episteme and neither field asserts a WorkPlan or actual Work.

4. **`ActionInvitationSense`.**
   Which action-oriented family is intended.

5. **Coupling frame.**
   The live coupling relation and admissible-use boundary under which the invitation is published.
   Examples: reach envelope, interface state, incident horizon, control horizon, probe pack, open issue set.

6. **Detector, viewpoint reference, and independent view.**
   Who or what detected the cue; which exact viewpoint episteme `viewpointRef` resolves to under the effective reference scheme when a viewpoint is selected; and, independently, which already-conforming `view : U.View` is cited when a view itself participates. None follows from another.

7. **Normal form and `articulationHint`.**
   How the invitation is published and how far it has been articulated.

8. **Scope and time when relevant.**
   `U.Scope` and `Γ_time` SHALL be explicit when omission changes meaning.

9. **Representation substrate when relevant.**
   Especially when comparing ecological, embodied, latent-distributed, and symbolic-local treatments.

10. **Witness mode and evidence references.**
    Exemplars, sensory traces, probe notes, kinematic data, interface events, controller traces, run logs, or review notes.

#### A.6.A:4.5 - Normal-form discipline

An `ActionInvitationSense` SHALL declare one admissible default normal form and MAY declare additional admissible normal forms explicitly.

**Docking note.**
Where a published invitation already points toward enactment, the candidate action SHOULD select the existing exact `U.Method` ref. A current `U.MethodDescription` ref remains a separate C.2.1 source for identifying, constraining or justifying that Method or intended Work; existing `U.WorkPlan` and `U.Work` refs remain separate when those objects already exist. `PolicyHook` SHALL always be a hook over pre-existing gate, method, or protocol publications; it does not mint a new Method, execution, admissibility, or deontic ontology.

**ANF-1 — `CuePack`.**
Use for early or low-articulation action invitations, especially `AIS.PhysicalAffordance`, `AIS.SocialAffordance`, and many cases of `AIS.LatentPolicyCue`.

A conforming `CuePack` publishes:

* exemplar or contrast episodes, sensory traces, or probe cues,
* site conditions,
* enactor descriptor or enactor constraints,
* a small gloss set of candidate actions,
* optional ordinal urgency or salience summaries,
* explicit warning that the cue is **not yet** a commitment, a selected method, a gate, or work,
* explicit note that witness-bearing does **not** by itself make the hinted action correct, required, or selected.

**ANF-2 — `ActionOption`.**
Use when one candidate action tuple is explicit.

A conforming `ActionOption` publishes:

* one candidate action tuple,
* invited enactor and role assignment when live,
* local guard sketch,
* expected near-field effect,
* an exact `U.Method` ref when the option is invited enactment, plus a separate optional `U.MethodDescription` ref or `U.WorkPlan` ref only when that independently existing object is current,
* explicit note that the option is **not yet selected**, **not yet obligatory**, and **not yet executed**.

**ANF-3 — `OptionSet`.**
Use when several candidate actions coexist.

A conforming `OptionSet` publishes:

* explicit action members,
* any local comparator, triage rule, or partial order,
* admissible incomparability if no total order is admissible,
* prohibition on hidden scalarisation.

**ANF-4 — `PolicyHook`.**
Use when the invitation is explicitly bound to an existing controller, gate, playbook, method, or override protocol.

A conforming `PolicyHook` publishes:

* referenced policy, method, gate, and protocol ids (pre-existing governing FPF patterns or `authoritySourceRef` named sources only),
* applicable guard or trigger conditions,
* admitted acting or maintaining System; any exact system-role kind or assignment needed by the hook's work context; the direct responsibility relation that selects that System, or the exact A.6.RCD missing governor; and any separate `authoritySourceRef` source,
* escalation or override references when relevant,
* explicit note that the hook is a **binding publication** over existing semantics, not itself a commitment, an admissibility rule, or a work occurrence.

#### A.6.A:4.6 - Separation from quality, capability, commitment, and work

A.6.A SHALL prevent the collapse of action invitation language into neighbouring families.

* A statement about **better, worse, fit, or merit** belongs to **C.16.Q**.
* A statement about **what a system can do in general** belongs to capability wording, method wording, or method-description wording under **A.6.F** and the subject pattern for the asserted capability, method, or method-description claim.
* A statement about **what must be done** belongs to **A.6.B** when the wording asserts an A-classified admissibility claim or a D-classified commitment claim.
* A statement about **what was actually done** belongs to **A.15** and exact dated `U.Work`, whose `enactsMethod` relation points to the exact `U.Method`.
* An invited enactment selects its exact Method without becoming a plan or occurrence; any `methodDescriptionRef` remains auxiliary. If an invitation points to a Description episteme, any later enactment still occurs through symbol carriers, acted-on systems, or both; the description itself never acts and is never what Work enacts.
* Mixed sentences that carry both evaluative and invitational content SHALL be split into `evaluativeAscription(...)` and `actionInvitation(...)` records, with explicit cross-references when the co-occurrence matters.

Mixed sentences SHALL be split.

Examples:

* “This scene is good for grasping” may require **both** `evaluativeAscription(...)` and `actionInvitation(...)`.
* “This alarm requires rollback” is **not** an admissible final affordance record; it needs explicit gate or duty classification.
* “The robot can grasp this handle” is a capability claim unless the situated site, enactor, coupling frame, and invitation are made explicit.
* “The operator clicked rollback” is work, not invitation.

#### A.6.A:4.7 - Bridge discipline across traditions

Whenever two traditions are compared using action-first language, first ask whether the comparison asserts or relies on semantic correspondence between exact senses in different semantic contexts. If it does, resolve those senses and test F.9; cite an obtaining Bridge only when its direct predicate is true, and state a separate bounded-use claim only when a proposed use is live. That claim carries the use, direction, correspondence rule, tolerated loss, and polarity. If the comparison does not assert or rely on that correspondence, use E.17.ID.CR for bounded comparative review or the exact direct relation that supplies the contrast, then stop. Add an F.9.1 stance note only as optional reader help for an already constituted bounded-use claim.

Useful stance labels include, for example:

* **`localRename`**
* **`operationalizes`**
* **`partialAnalogy`**
* **`projection`**
* **`nonEquivalent`**

Examples:

* A named comparison between `AIS.PhysicalAffordance` and `AIS.InterfaceAffordance` may remain a direct bounded contrast under E.17.ID.CR or another exact direct relation. If it asserts cross-context semantic correspondence, any bounded partial analogy needs an obtaining F.9 Bridge and a matching use claim. An optional `partialAnalogy` note helps reject identity; the label alone establishes nothing.
* `AIS.EpistemicProbe` and `AIS.ClosureAdvance` usually need the direct progression-by-closure relation that is actually claimed. If their senses cross semantic contexts, apply F.9 before adding any optional stance note.
* A named use from `AIS.LatentPolicyCue` toward `AIS.ControlOpportunity` needs F.9 only when it relies on cross-context semantic correspondence; then any operationalization or projection reading follows the obtaining Bridge and the use claim's direction, rule, and tolerated loss. Otherwise the exact direct relation must supply the proposed contrast or use.
* A robotics comparison from `AIS.PhysicalAffordance` toward `PolicyHook` may remain a direct contrast. If it relies on cross-context semantic correspondence, a projection reading requires the obtaining F.9 Bridge and a matching bounded-use claim under the controller frame; an F.9.1 note only explains that existing claim.
* Action invitation and quality ascription may co-occur, but co-occurrence is **not** identity.

#### A.6.A:4.8 - Change lexicon

A conforming pattern SHALL narrate changes with a stable change lexicon aligned to A.6.P:

* **`declareActionInvitation(...)`** — create a new explicit action invitation record.
* **`withdrawActionInvitation(...)`** — retire a prior record.
* **`retargetSite(...)`** — change the site tuple while keeping the same relation family.
* **`retargetInvitedEnactor(...)`** — change the invited enactor tuple when that slot is ref-backed.
* **`reviseAction(...)`** — change the candidate action tuple by value (or split into the corresponding `retargetParticipant(...)` form if the local relation specification makes the action slot ref-backed).
* **`reviseSense(...)`** — change the value in the `actionInvitationSense` slot.
* **`reArticulate(...)`** — change the `articulationHint` while preserving sense family.
* **`reFrame(...)`** — change coupling frame.
* **`reGuard(...)`** — change guard sketch or hook condition.
* **`rePolicyHook(...)`** — change policy, gate, or method hook details.
* **`reView(...)`** — change detector publication, ref-backed viewpoint selection, or independent view inclusion under the declared ref-vs-value discipline. Changing `viewpointRef` does not mutate the viewpoint episteme; adding or replacing `view` does not establish E.17.0 conformance.
* **`rescope(...)`** — change `U.Scope`.
* **`retime(...)`** — change `Γ_time`.
* **`refreshWitnesses(...)`** — refresh witness bindings.
* **`changeRelationKind(...)`** — semantic move to a different relation family; never edit in place silently.

A silent move from invitation to commitment, capability, or work is a breaking semantic change.

**A.6.P rewrite note.**
`retargetSite(...)` and `retargetInvitedEnactor(...)` are family-specific refinements of participant retargeting and SHALL be used only when the corresponding slots are ref-backed. `reviseAction(...)`, `reviseSense(...)`, `reArticulate(...)`, `reFrame(...)`, `reGuard(...)`, and `rePolicyHook(...)` are by-value revisions unless the local relation specification explicitly declares the corresponding slot as ref-backed, in which case the text SHALL use the matching `retargetParticipant(...)` form. This preserves A.6.5’s ref-vs-value discipline.

#### A.6.A:4.8a - A.6.B classification template for `actionInvitation`

When an action invitation becomes boundary-bearing, classify it explicitly:

* **L** — `actionInvitation` relation specification skeleton, `ActionInvitationSense` semantics, normal-form admissibility, enactor and site discipline, and the boundary between an F.9 bounded-use claim and any optional F.9.1 stance note.
* **A** — admissibility conditions for using the invitation in selector use, triage use, automation use, or publication use.
* **D** — duties on authors, operators, or stewards of the named source with authority-reference relation: lexical firewall, naming the invited actor, naming the hook `authoritySourceRef` source, naming override paths where required.
* **E** — carrier-referenced witnesses: sensory traces, interface events, probe notes, controller logs, run traces, incident records.

Do not let bare action-first language carry L-, A-, D-, or E-classified claims, admissible-use consequences, or evidence consequences by itself.

#### A.6.A:4.9 - Lexical guardrails

In **Tech prose and normative prose**:

* bare **affords, invites, calls for, actionable, ready for, ripe for, natural next step, the model wants, or the interface tells** MUST NOT appear without immediate repair;
* **actionable insight** MUST be rewritten to `ActionOption`, `OptionSet`, or `PolicyHook`, or to **C.16.Q** if the use is primarily evaluative;
* **affordance** MUST NOT be treated as a monadic property of a site participant without enactor, site, and coupling frame;
* an invitation MUST NOT be presented as if it were already a duty, gate, or work occurrence;
* a latent policy cue MUST NOT be presented as if it were already an explanation;
* `articulationHint` MUST NOT be treated as **F**, as acceptance status, or as a replacement for `A.16` grounding references;
* generic `Surface` facet tokens MUST NOT be introduced inside A.6.A; publication face, publication form, interop publication form, carrier, or rendering participation must be declared under A.7 and publication-face and publication-form discipline, not by widening the site classification;
* hidden enactor language inside adjectives such as *graspable*, *deployable*, *actionable*, *ready* SHALL be unpacked;
* quoted metalinguistic uses are allowed, but SHALL be marked as token-under-discussion.

#### A.6.A:4.10 - Progressive elaboration

A.6.A allows monotone elaboration:

1. Start by selecting an `ActionInvitationSense` and recording rival candidates when ambiguity is live.
2. Declare site, would-be enactor, action, frame, and site-facet relation binding; if the action is enactment, select the exact Method and keep any description ref auxiliary.
3. Choose an admissible normal form and a local `articulationHint` when omission would hide articulation state.
4. Add guards, method hooks, policy hooks, and witness bindings.
5. If a `CuePack` or `ActionOption` is projected into `OptionSet` or `PolicyHook`, or connected to **C.16.Q**, **A.6.B**, or the relevant **A.15** pattern family, publish an explicit projection or operationalization note rather than silently upgrading the invitation.
6. If traditions are compared, first ask whether the comparison asserts or relies on cross-context semantic correspondence. If yes, test F.9 and cite an obtaining Bridge only when its predicate is true; add a matching bounded-use claim only when the proposed use is live. If no, use E.17.ID.CR or the exact direct relation that supplies the contrast. Add an F.9.1 stance note only when it helps read an already constituted claim.
7. If the invitation becomes boundary-bearing, emit the relevant L, A, D, and E decomposition hooks and, where enactment is implied, apply the relevant A.15 pattern family.
8. Never move from invitation into capability, commitment, or work silently.

#### A.6.A:4.10a - Endpoint-first downstream discipline

If a repaired phrase already names an admissible downstream `authoritySourceRef`, `relationFunctionClaimRef`, or P2W method-to-work reference such as a gate hook, exact Method ref, separate MethodDescription ref, `U.WorkPlan`, declaration-local planned-filling row addressed through that WorkPlan, or `U.Work` occurrence, authors SHOULD publish that downstream reference directly and keep `actionInvitation(...)` only as the preceding repair record when the invitation semantics themselves still matter. `actionInvitation(...)` is therefore a post-threshold invitation record, not a shadow substitute for `A.6.B`, `A.15`, or gate-subject patterns.

### A.6.A:5 - Archetypal Grounding

#### A.6.A:5.1 - Tell

If a draft says *affords*, *calls for*, *invites*, or *actionable*, the author has not yet named the action-oriented family.

A conforming post-threshold rewrite publishes one explicit `actionInvitation(...)` with one `ActionInvitationSense`, one site tuple, one invited enactor tuple, one candidate action tuple, one coupling frame, one normal form, and explicit articulation, scope, time, and substrate qualifiers when they matter. Earlier action-guiding cue content may still remain outside A.6.A as cue-pack content, a `RoutedCueSet`, or another typed cue-preserving upstream publication until threshold conditions are met.

#### A.6.A:5.2 - Show (System case)

**Draft:** “The alarm calls for rollback.”

**Repair A — control and incident line**

`actionInvitation(`
`  site = AlarmBundle_AB9 × ServiceState_S7,`
`  siteClassification = { AlarmBundle_AB9: non-claim-bearing carrier site, ServiceState_S7: EntityOfConcern },`
`  publicationOrCarrierParticipation = { AlarmBundle_AB9: carrier exposing cue },`
`  invitedEnactor = OpsTeam_Phoenix,`
`  candidateAction = Enact(methodRef = RollbackMethod_R41, methodDescriptionRef = RollbackRunbook_R41, actedOn = Release_R41),`
`  actionInvitationSense = AIS.ControlOpportunity,`
`  couplingFrame = IncidentPolicy_IP2 × Horizon_H15m,`
`  detector = AnomalyPolicy_AP7,`
`  viewpointRef = U.ViewpointRef(VP.OperationsControl),`
`  effectiveReferenceScheme = OperationsControlScheme_2026,`
`  view = OperationsRollbackView_9,`
`  normalForm = PolicyHook,`
`  articulationHint = hook-explicit,`
`  scope = U.WorkScope(ProdCluster_EU_1),`
`  Γ_time = RunWindow_RW,`
`  witnesses = {AlertTrace_91, ErrorBudgetSeries_4}`
`)`

`VP.OperationsControl` is independently admitted as a `U.Viewpoint` episteme and is resolved by `viewpointRef` under `OperationsControlScheme_2026`. `OperationsRollbackView_9` is independently identified under C.2.1 and is a `U.View` only because `EpistemeViewpointConformanceRelation(OperationsRollbackView_9, VP.OperationsControl)` independently obtains under E.17.0. Their inclusion in the invitation record establishes neither membership. The invitation selects `RollbackMethod_R41` for its candidate enactment but does not create a WorkPlan or assert that rollback Work occurred; `RollbackRunbook_R41` remains an auxiliary MethodDescription.

**Recognizable near misses.** `Enact(methodDescriptionRef = RollbackRunbook_R41)` with no exact Method is unresolved invited enactment, not a usable action option. `viewpoint = VP.OperationsControl` stores a dependent-kind value by name and hides reference resolution. A `viewpointRef` alone does not make a diagram or dashboard a `U.View`; a `view` field alone does not make its episteme conform. An alarm, invitation record or PolicyHook alone does not prove duty, gate passage or performed rollback Work.

**Repair B — ecological and robot line**

**Draft:** “This handle affords pulling.”

`actionInvitation(`
`  site = DoorHandle_17 × DoorState_Closed × ReachEnvelope_RE2,`
`  siteClassification = { DoorHandle_17: EntityOfConcern, DoorState_Closed: EntityOfConcern, ReachEnvelope_RE2: Description episteme },`
`  invitedEnactor = ServiceRobot_R2,`
`  candidateAction = PullAlong(Axis_A1),`
`  actionInvitationSense = AIS.PhysicalAffordance,`
`  couplingFrame = GripClass_G1 × ClearanceProfile_CP3,`
`  detector = PerceptionStack_PS4,`
`  normalForm = ActionOption,`
`  articulationHint = option-explicit,`
`  Γ_time = Window_W1,`
`  witnesses = {DepthFrame_883, ContactModelRun_17}`
`)`

#### A.6.A:5.3 - Show (Episteme case)

**Draft:** “This problem asks for a better question.”

**Repair A — epistemic probe line**

`actionInvitation(`
`  site = ProblemFramingEpisode_PF3,`
`  siteClassification = { ProblemFramingEpisode_PF3: Description episteme },`
`  invitedEnactor = ResearchTeam_A,`
`  candidateAction = Enact(methodRef = ContrastiveQuestioningMethod_Q2, methodDescriptionRef = ContrastiveQuestioning_Q2),`
`  actionInvitationSense = AIS.EpistemicProbe,`
`  couplingFrame = ExemplarPack_EP3 × OpenIssueSet_O2,`
`  detector = Reviewer_A1,`
`  normalForm = OptionSet,`
`  articulationHint = sketched,`
`  representationSubstrate = hybrid,`
`  witnesses = {EpisodeNotes_3, CounterexampleCard_2}`
`)`

**Repair B — closure-advance line**

**Draft:** “The draft is ready for formalization.”

`actionInvitation(`
`  site = DraftHypothesis_H7,`
`  siteClassification = { DraftHypothesis_H7: Description episteme },`
`  invitedEnactor = AuthorCollective_C1,`
`  candidateAction = Formalize_DescEp_SpecDesc(TypedInvariantSet_V1),`
`  actionInvitationSense = AIS.ClosureAdvance,`
`  couplingFrame = AmbiguityMemo_8 × ClaimScope_G1,`
`  detector = ReviewPanel_R4,`
`  normalForm = ActionOption,`
`  articulationHint = option-explicit,`
`  representationSubstrate = symbolic-local,`
`  witnesses = {AmbiguityMemo_8, ReviewCommentSet_5}`
`)`

### A.6.A:6 - Bias-Annotation

Lenses tested: **Gov**, **Arch**, **Ontology and episteme**, **Prag**, **Did**. Scope: **Universal** for overloaded affordance-like and action-first language in FPF-governed wording.

* **Gov bias:** this pattern may tempt authors to smuggle decisions into invitation language.
  *Mitigation:* explicit A.6.B claim classification and obligation barrier.
* **Arch bias:** this pattern prefers one stable relation family over loose action talk.
  *Mitigation:* allow Plain exploratory prose before Tech prose or normative publication.
* **Ontology and episteme bias:** this pattern insists on separating invitation from evaluation, capability, commitment, and work.
  *Mitigation:* first separate a direct contrast from a cross-context semantic-correspondence claim; test F.9 only for the latter, and keep any bounded-use claim and optional F.9.1 reading note separate.
* **Prag bias:** it favors enactor, site, and action explicitness, which raises authoring cost.
  *Mitigation:* small starter set, normal-form discipline, and copyable rewrites.
* **Did bias:** repeated rewrites make the pattern teachable, but may over-formalize early cues.
  *Mitigation:* `CuePack` and local `articulationHint` keep early stages admissible without pretending closure.

### A.6.A:7 - Conformance Checklist (CC-A.6.A)

A text or pattern conforms to A.6.A iff:

1. **CC-A.6.A-1 — Explicit post-threshold relation family and explicit sense.**
   Every in-scope post-threshold action-first use resolves to one declared `actionInvitation(...)` instance and one declared `ActionInvitationSense`; earlier cue-like content stays under `A.16.1` or `B.4.1` instead of being forced into A.6.A prematurely.
2. **CC-A.6.A-2 — Explicit site and site-facet relation binding.**
   The site tuple is explicit; when ambiguous or mixed, the site classification over the EntityOfConcern and Description-episteme boundary is explicit, and publication or carrier participation is stated separately when live.

3. **CC-A.6.A-3 — Explicit invited enactor.**
   The invited enactor tuple is explicit.

4. **CC-A.6.A-4 — Enactor discipline.**
   When the invited enactor is meant as the actual would-be enactor, it resolves to a `U.System` or role assignment with system holder.

5. **CC-A.6.A-5 — Explicit candidate action and Method when enactment is invited.**
   The candidate action tuple is explicit and reviewable. If it is enactment, it selects exact `methodRef -> U.Method`; any `methodDescriptionRef` remains a separate C.2.1 episteme and neither selection establishes intended or actual Work.

6. **CC-A.6.A-6 — Explicit coupling frame.**
   The coupling frame is explicit.

7. **CC-A.6.A-7 — Detector, viewpoint reference, and view separation.**
   When current, `detector`, ref-backed `viewpointRef`, its effective reference scheme, and independent optional `view` are not silently collapsed. The reference resolves to an exact admitted viewpoint episteme; a cited view already passes E.17.0 independently.

8. **CC-A.6.A-8 — Lawful normal form.**
   The invitation is published as `CuePack`, `ActionOption`, `OptionSet`, or `PolicyHook`, with corresponding discipline observed.

9. **CC-A.6.A-9 — Articulation-hint discipline.**
   If omission changes meaning, `articulationHint` is explicit and is not treated as **F** or as an acceptance state.

10. **CC-A.6.A-10 — No invitation-as-obligation.**
    An invitation is not silently published as a duty or gate.

11. **CC-A.6.A-11 — No invitation-as-work.**
    An invitation is not silently published as a work occurrence.

12. **CC-A.6.A-12 — No capability collapse.**
    A situated invitation is not silently rewritten as a general capability claim.

13. **CC-A.6.A-13 — No site-participant-property collapse.**
    Affordance language is not published as a monadic site-participant property when enactor, site, and coupling frame matter.

14. **CC-A.6.A-14 — No hidden scalarisation.**
    `OptionSet` publication does not introduce a hidden comparator value or ranking without an explicit comparator or policy.

15. **CC-A.6.A-15 — No silent sense rewrite.**
    Sense changes use the declared change lexicon.

16. **CC-A.6.A-16 — No silent relation-family switch.**
    Moving from invitation to quality ascription, capability, commitment, or work uses `changeRelationKind(...)` or an explicit split.

17. **CC-A.6.A-17 — Bridge accountability.**
    A cross-tradition comparison first states whether it asserts or relies on semantic correspondence between exact senses in different semantic contexts. If yes, it cites an obtaining F.9 Bridge only after the predicate passes and adds a matching bounded-use claim only when a proposed use is live. If no, it uses E.17.ID.CR or the exact direct relation that supplies the contrast. Any F.9.1 stance note remains optional reader help for an already constituted claim.

18. **CC-A.6.A-18 — Boundary-claim hook when needed.**
    If the repaired invitation is used for admissibility, commitments, publication, or automation, downstream L-, A-, D-, or E-classified hooks are explicit.

19. **CC-A.6.A-19 — Lexical firewall.**
    Bare action-first trigger tokens are absent from Tech prose and normative prose except as quoted metalinguistic discussion.

20. **CC-A.6.A-20 — `actionInvitation` relation specification skeleton is published.**
    The family-specific `RelationKind` token resolves to a relation specification skeleton with SlotSpecs, enactor and site discipline, qualifier expectations, repair sequences, witness discipline, admissible change classes, and cross-context policy.

21. **CC-A.6.A-21 — Candidate-Set Note is used when ambiguity is live.**
    If the site classification, publication or carrier participation, enactor classification, relation family, or sense selection is non-obvious, the text records a short Candidate-Set Note before decision-bearing use.

22. **CC-A.6.A-22 — Record inclusion grants no dependent-kind membership.**
    `viewpointRef` resolves under the effective reference scheme to an independently admitted `U.Viewpoint`; optional `view` names an independently identified episteme whose `U.View` membership follows only from exact E.17.0 conformance. Neither field nor the invitation record establishes either membership.

### A.6.A:8 - Common Anti-Patterns and How to Avoid Them

| Anti-pattern                   | Symptom                                                                                     | Why it fails                                           | How to avoid or repair                                           |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Site-participant-property affordance** | "The site participant is actionable" with no enactor or coupling frame | collapses relationality into monadic property language | publish site, enactor, action, and coupling frame |
| **Invitation-as-obligation**   | "This calls for rollback" is treated as if rollback is already required                     | hides A-classified or D-classified claim status and accountability | publish `actionInvitation(...)`, then classify duty or gate use with A.6.B |
| **Invitation-as-work**         | “The system reacted” is used where only a cue or option exists                              | confuses offer with execution                          | keep invitation separate from A.15 and `U.Work`                   |
| **MethodDescription as invited Method** | `Enact(methodDescriptionRef=Runbook)` supplies no exact Method | makes a C.2.1 episteme the world-side way of doing | select exact `methodRef -> U.Method`; keep the description auxiliary |
| **Viewpoint or view by record inclusion** | a field name or bundle row is treated as proof of `U.Viewpoint` or `U.View` | bypasses reference resolution and E.17.0 dependent-kind rules | resolve `viewpointRef` under the effective scheme and establish any view's conformance independently |
| **Capability-as-invitation**   | “The robot can do X” stands in for a situated affordance                                    | destroys local enactor and site conditions             | separate capability description from action invitation          |
| **Latent cue as explanation**  | a model tendency is narrated as if it were already an explicit rationale                    | overstates articulation and evidence                   | keep as `CuePack` or `OptionSet` until further articulation     |
| **Premature automation**       | a cue without required witness records is wired directly into gates or controllers with no explicit hook `authoritySourceRef` named source or guard | creates unsafe action-to-automation coupling                         | require `PolicyHook`, A.6.B claim classification, and witnesses                |
| **ArticulationHint as F proxy**| `hook-explicit` is treated as "more formal"                                                | recreates a forbidden second formality characteristic          | keep F in C.2.3; reserve articulation and closure semantics for `A.16` |

### A.6.A:9 - Consequences

**Benefits.**
This pattern gives FPF an admissible **post-threshold repair record family** for **action-first** discourse. It lets embodied, ecological, latent, interface, and control cues be published without pretending they are already commitments, capabilities, characteristics, scales, or work.

It also complements C.16.Q cleanly: C.16.Q repairs **evaluative** ambiguity, while A.6.A repairs **action-inviting** ambiguity.

**Trade-offs and mitigations.**
The pattern adds authoring overhead and can feel heavy in early exploration.

Mitigation: allow bare action-first language in Plain exploratory notes, but require repair before it enters Tech prose, normative prose, boundary, automation, assurance, or publication use.

### A.6.A:10 - Rationale

A.6.A makes one strategic move:

> **Affordance-like and action-first language is not treated as a monadic property and not treated as a hidden duty. It is treated as a family of action invitations whose members differ by site, enactor, candidate action, coupling frame, substrate, and admissible publication form.**

This bridge interpretation is intentionally neutral: in ecological settings the site is **not** treated as a literal speaker or norm-giver. "Invitation" is the stable publishable FPF lens for situated opportunity-to-act talk, not a claim that all source traditions use that word or share one ontology.

This gives FPF an admissible treatment for:

* ecological and embodied affordances,
* interface and operator prompts,
* epistemic "probe this", "formalize this", and "reframe this" moves,
* latent policy cues in learned systems,
* control opportunities in closed loops,

without forcing them into one false universal vocabulary.

It also keeps the larger architecture clean:

* **C.16.Q** governs evaluative repairs,
* **A.6.A** governs action-invitation repairs,
* **A.6.B** governs boundary claim classification,
* **A.15** governs enactment and work,
* **A.16** governs articulation and closure progression and admissible moves,
* **C.2.3** remains the sole subject pattern for formality characteristic **F**.

### A.6.A:11 - SoTA-Echoing

Recent philosophical and ecological work treats affordances as **action-relevant possibilities** perceived in engagement and, in some accounts, as **invitations for action**, rather than as viewpoint-free monadic site-participant properties. A.6.A adopts that relational, action-first stance, adapts it by forcing explicit `siteTuple`, `invitedEnactorTuple`, and `couplingFrame` publication, and rejects silent collapse into monadic site-participant labels. ([Frontiers][1], [Springer][2])

Recent empirical review work on affordance perception emphasises **attunement and recalibration** in person-plus-environment systems rather than fixed, context-free labels. A.6.A adopts the need for enactor- and situation-specific publication, adapts it into `CuePack`, `ActionOption`, and `OptionSet` normal forms, and rejects any assumption that an affordance phrase is already an admissible characteristic, scale, or universally portable invariant. ([Springer][2])

Current active-inference work frames generative models in **action-perception loops** and, in many cases, **action-oriented models** that are for adaptive interaction rather than only detached description. A.6.A adopts the action-oriented emphasis and the separation between model-side cueing and enacted action; it adapts this by making `detector` and `invitedEnactor` explicit and by forbidding latent policy cues from counting as work, commitment, or explicit rationale by default.

Current robotics work increasingly uses affordances as **intermediate representations** between perception-language representations and concrete action, including compact keypoint or staged affordance plans. A.6.A adopts this as evidence that affordance publication can be an admissible intermediate publication form; it adapts it into `ActionOption`, `OptionSet`, and `PolicyHook`, and rejects silent promotion of such representations into deontic obligation, proof of correctness, or objective value. ([Robotics: Science and Systems][4])

**Coverage note.**
This section already covers the claim-bearing relational and action-oriented stance. Operator-facing interface practice should also cite explicit operator-interaction, operator-alarm, and incident-response source lines so that its evidence relation is as direct as the current ecology, active-inference, and robotics branch.

### A.6.A:12 - Relations

* **Specialises:** **A.6.P** as an RPR pattern for overloaded affordance-like and action-first language.
* **Builds on:** **A.3** and **A.7** for enactor discipline and EntityOfConcern and Description-episteme plus publication and carrier separation; **A.15** for keeping invitation distinct from enactment; **A.6.B** for boundary claim classification; **E.17.0**, **E.17**, and **E.18** for viewpoint reference resolution, independent view conformance, and viewpoint publication.
* **Works alongside:** **C.16.Q** for evaluative language; the two are siblings, not substitutes.
* **Coordinates with:** **C.2.2a, A.16, A.16.1, A.16.2, and B.4.1** for language-state chart positions, admissible moves before post-threshold repair, and retreat when a published invitation must be reopened; use **A.16.0** only when lineage, branch, loss, or an actual responsibility-handoff history itself must be published as an explicit trajectory account; **B.5.2.0** for probe-question cases that are still prompt-shaped; **C.2.LS, C.2.4, C.2.5, C.2.6, and C.2.7** for language-state facet governance.
* **Must not replace:** **C.2.3** as the single subject pattern for **F**.
* **Recommends publication via:** **E.10, F.17, and F.18** when `actionInvitation` tokens, starter senses, and red-flag rewrites become shared vocabulary.

#### A.6.A:12.1 - Language-space refactor note
This pattern is scoped to **action-invitation repair and endpoint continuation**, not to the whole early cue family. Early action-guiding cue content may remain in `A.16.1` as cue-pack content, a `RoutedCueSet`, or another typed cue-preserving upstream publication before it stabilizes into `actionInvitation(...)`.

#### A.6.A:12.2 - Canonical downstream relation
`actionInvitation(...)` should be classified through `A.6.B` and connected to `A.15` when work enactment is live toward gates, commitments, methods, or work. Operator-facing starter senses such as `AIS.AlertInterventionCue` or `AIS.OperatorInterventionCue` should not be buried under generic `AIS.InterfaceAffordance` when human factors and policy hooks substantively differ.

#### A.6.A:12.3 - Governance boundary
This pattern may cite an F.9 Bridge and bounded-use claim, an optional F.9.1 stance note, an A.16 articulation-state result, authority-reference fields, or language-state facet characteristics from `C.2.LS`, `C.2.4`, `C.2.5`, `C.2.6`, and `C.2.7`; it does not redefine any of them.
