## A.6.F - Function and Functional Precision Restoration (RPR-FUNCTION)

> **Type:** Architectural pattern
> **Status:** Stable
> **Normativity:** Normative unless explicitly marked informative

### A.6.F:1 - Problem frame

Use this pattern when `function`, `functional`, `functionality`, `effect`, or a similar function-like phrase carries an FPF claim beyond ordinary prose. The reading to inspect may concern architecture, work, method, capability, a system-role kind or assignment, participation, actual functioning, responsibility, quality, mathematics, module allocation, an interface, or another claim named by value. These are recognition and dispatch possibilities, not one semantic kind.

The first useful move is to recover the exact object or claim and its subject pattern. Return the repaired wording, next admissible use, and needed stop or subject-pattern return. Use the following `FunctionUseRepair` note only when a receiving use needs the repair to remain inspectable:

```text
FunctionUseRepair:
phrase:
sourceCueText?:
functionLikeReadingUnderRepair:
exactGovernedObjectOrClaim:
directRelationPredicateUse?:
relationalAssertionUse?:
obtainingRelationOccurrenceUse?:
reusableDeclarationUse?:
selectedClaimBearingEpistemeUse?:
representationUse?:
subjectPatternApplicationRefs?:
blockedLocalOverreadRefs?:
nextAdmissibleUse:
stopCondition:
```
Stop when the source cue, exact entity, value, claim, or claim-bearing episteme, subject pattern, and the next admissible use are clear. If the next step must test whether named participants stand in a relation, add its admitted direct predicate. If it must preserve an affirmative, negative, or modal claim about that predicate, identify the exact `C.2.1` relational-assertion episteme and its claim. If it must track one particular obtaining instance, apply the subject pattern's identity rule and add the separately individuated occurrence. Otherwise leave those three branches empty. Add reusable declaration, other selected assertion, specification, or view episteme, or representation correspondence only when the next step needs it.

What goes wrong if A.6.F is missed: a function becomes a root kind; functional architecture becomes a peer ontology beside architecture; a capability becomes a function; a method or work occurrence becomes a function; a mathematical function becomes design ontology; a module allocation becomes functional truth; or a quality claim hides behind "functionality".

What A.6.F buys in practice: the practitioner can keep useful engineering language while naming the exact object or claim and going straight to its subject pattern. Direct participation, reusable declaration, claim-bearing description, and representation remain separate instead of becoming one generic function record.

Not this pattern when the phrase is ordinary prose and carries no FPF claim being made. If the issue under repair is a general relation word, evaluative language, grounded architecture adequacy, or an architecture structural view, use `A.6.P`, `C.16.Q`, `C.30`, or `C.30.ASV` respectively.

**E.10.ARCH subject-pattern relation.** When `E.10` encounters function-like wording whose exact entity, value, claim, claim-bearing episteme, direct relation, or subject pattern is hidden, `E.10.ARCH` may apply `A.6.F` until that object and the remaining action are clear or the wording is lowered to ordinary prose, quote-only wording, reduced-use cue, blocked use, or incomplete rewrite. A direct relation names its actual participants; a reusable `RelationSignature` and declaration-local `SlotSpec`s, selected assertion, specification, or view episteme, and C.29 representation correspondence are added only for a current receiving use. After recovery, apply the subject pattern; `A.6.F` alone establishes no architecture, mathematics, quality, work, evidence, assurance, gate, decision, or release claim.

### A.6.F:2 - Problem

FPF texts repeatedly use function-like wording for different FPF kinds and relations:

- required transformation or effect in an architecture view;
- capability of a holon;
- method wording;
- work occurrence or work result;
- a system-role kind or assignment, participation, actual functioning, or responsibility;
- mathematical function or relation;
- quality, fitness, or characteristic wording;
- module allocation or interface relation;
- functional architecture shorthand.

These uses are all legitimate in ordinary engineering speech. They are not the same FPF object or claim. If the text does not name the exact entity, value, claim, or claim-bearing episteme and its subject pattern, subsequent reasoning cannot tell whether the sentence is about architecture, behavior, work, a system-role kind or assignment, participation, actual functioning, responsibility, mathematics, module structure, quality, evidence, or decision. When a separate direct relation, reusable declaration, assertion or specification, selected view, or representation is current, identify it as that separate object.

### A.6.F:3 - Forces

| Force | Tension |
| --- | --- |
| Familiar engineering speech vs object and claim precision | Engineers naturally say "function", "functional", and "functionality"; when the phrase carries an FPF claim, the exact entity, value, claim, or claim-bearing episteme and its subject pattern must be recoverable. |
| Functional architecture vs peer ontology | Functional architecture is useful, but it is the `FunctionalStructure` case of `ArchitectureOf@Context`, not a separate root architecture kind. |
| Capability or effect vs work or method | A function-like phrase may describe what a holon can do, what a method prescribes, or what work has done; those are different values, claims, epistemes, and, where applicable, direct relations, each with its own subject pattern. |
| Mathematical function vs design relation | Mathematical functions and relations can be used for reasoning; use C.29 to test their lens use and stop condition. |
| Module allocation vs functional relation | Functional dependencies may be allocated to modules, but function and module-interface structure do not become one FPF kind. |
| Small repair vs unneeded evidence, quality, decision, or assurance apparatus | Most cases need the exact object or claim, its subject pattern, and a stop condition. Add direct-relation participants, reusable declaration, selected claim-bearing episteme, or representation correspondence only when the current use needs that object. |

### A.6.F:4 - Solution

A.6.F is an A.6.P RPR specialization for function-like wording. It does not mint `U.Function`. It assigns the use under repair to an exact entity, value, claim, or claim-bearing episteme and its subject pattern, then stops unless another claim remains current. It does not package direct relations, declaration-local `SlotSpec`s, assertions, specifications, views, and representation elements as peer records.

#### A.6.F:4.1 - Trigger rule

A.6.F applies when function-like wording may carry one or more of these independently established readings. The list is a recognition and dispatch palette, not a `U.*` kind, claim kind, relation kind, or admission result:

The familiar estimate of roughly seven meanings is only a recall cue, not a fixed count. Several entries below unfold into different objects, claims, and relations, function wording often transfers metonymically among them, and one occurrence may carry more than one reading. Recover what the sentence actually says rather than assigning it to a numbered meaning.

- architecture or functional architecture;
- capability, effect, externally promised behavior, or user-visible functionality;
- method wording, work occurrence, or work result;
- a system-role kind or assignment, participation, actual functioning, or responsibility;
- mathematical function, mapping, relation, loss, objective, or value functional;
- quality, fitness, characteristic, score, or proxy wording;
- module allocation, interface, signature, port, API, protocol, flow, or mechanism relation;
- another independently established claim named by value, such as evidence, assurance, gate, decision, or release.

If none of those readings carries a current FPF claim, the wording may remain ordinary Plain prose.

#### A.6.F:4.2 - FunctionUseRepair

`FunctionUseRepair` is an optional pattern-local repair note for a receiving use that needs inspectable detail. Its `functionLikeReadingUnderRepair` value only helps a reader recognize and dispatch a possible reading; neither that value nor the three scan groups below is a `U.*` kind, claim kind, relation kind, or admission result. The recovered result belongs in `exactGovernedObjectOrClaim` under its subject pattern. The note carries no project-publication, evidence, decision, or `U.Function` authority. `FunctionalStructure` is an `ArchitectureStructureKindRef` value under C.30.ASV, not a kernel Function kind.

The repair is complete when a practitioner can name the exact object or claim, apply its subject pattern, and state the remaining action. When a note is needed, at least one exact entity or value, claim or claim content, or claim-bearing episteme is required in `exactGovernedObjectOrClaim`. A source cue stays in `sourceCueText`; it is not a recovered value. When a direct relation is current, first name its admitted kind, semantic predicate, and actual participants in `directRelationPredicateUse`. Add `relationalAssertionUse` only when one exact `C.2.1` episteme affirms, denies, or otherwise modalizes that predicate. Add `obtainingRelationOccurrenceUse` only when the receiving use needs one separately individuated obtaining occurrence under the subject pattern's identity rule, applied through `A.6.REL`; a predicate or assertion never supplies occurrence identity. Add a reusable `RelationSignature` and declaration-local `SlotSpec`s only for reusable typed use; add another selected assertion, specification, or view episteme only when it is a separate claim-bearing object; add a C.29 representation element and explicit correspondence only when representation matters. If the text still hides a function, capability, work, method, system-role kind or assignment, participation, functioning, responsibility, module, evidence, gate, or mathematical-function collapse, the repair is incomplete.

Preserve the subject's necessary applicability and stop conditions in the repaired claim. Add `blockedLocalOverreadRefs` or `nonAdmissibleUse` as an explanatory guard only under F.19:4's full independent-ground, plausible-reader, contribution, and smallest-clear-correction test. An unused guard may be omitted without an absence entry.

#### A.6.F:4.3 - Repair assignments

When a function-like phrase is claim-bearing, recover the exact object or claim under concern before lowering or rewriting the phrase. C.30.ASV does not define a world-side or view-local `FunctionalElement` individual. Its `FunctionalStructureView` is the same `ArchitectureStructuralView` episteme about one selected functional `U.Structure`; a `FunctionalStructureViewUse` may cite exact `FunctionalElementClaim` epistemes and other values needed by the use. Required or desired effects, actual transformations, candidate bearers, capabilities, ports, allocations, and correspondences remain separately established claims or values. If a distinct functional-element individual is genuinely needed, first define its predicate and identity in a subject pattern; otherwise stop at the smaller exact requirement, behavior or effect claim, capability, participant, condition, port declaration, or other directly defined object. A field name or source cue is not a substitute for that object.

**Method-description guard.** A procedure, code file, solver model, recipe, protocol, or algorithm is only a clue. First identify the knowledge object and the exact method it is about. Then point to at least one claim that says how that method is done, such as its transformation or enactment concern, applicability, precondition, intended effect or preserved condition, bound, generic participant meaning, or internal method composition. Only then classify that already identified `U.Episteme` as `U.MethodDescription` under A.3.2. A title, author, citation, approval, file form, or runnable artifact alone is a near-miss. If no admitted `U.Method` is its exact `EntityOfConcern`, or no way-of-doing claim is present, do not use `U.MethodDescription`: keep the actual plan, work, result, formal substrate, mechanism declaration, representation, publication occurrence or form, or carrier with its subject pattern. A different code, text, diagram, or publication form does not decide membership. If claim content, exact method, or effective reference scheme changes, C.2.1 first identifies the resulting episteme; then apply A.3.2 to that individual.

| Function wording use | Recovered object or claim and subject pattern | Boundary |
| --- | --- | --- |
| required or desired functional behavior, transformation, or effect | Keep the requirement or other claim about the required or desired behavior or effect with its exact requirement, architecture, capability-gap, functional-view, method, or other claim-bearing pattern. Use `U.Transformation` only for one independently grounded actual bounded change under A.3.4. Use `TransformationFlowStructure` only for an independently selected structure over explicitly named loci, not for the required effect itself. | Requirement wording establishes neither an occurrence nor a filled `FunctionalElementClaim`. Stop at the claim pattern unless the changed referent, boundary, conditions, actual before/during/after facts, and continuity or reidentification rule are grounded. A functional view may cite the required claim, selected structure, bearer candidate, capability, and allocation without saying that the change occurred. |
| functional element in a view | Under C.30.ASV, use one `ArchitectureStructuralView` episteme whose `EntityOfConcern` is one selected functional `U.Structure`. When needed, add a `FunctionalStructureViewUse` that cites exact C.2.1 `FunctionalElementClaim` epistemes and only separately established behavior or effect, bearer, capability, port, allocation, or correspondence values. | This is a claim-and-view interface, not a `FunctionalElement` individual, loose table row, or module. If no bearer or candidate allocation is current, keep the requirement, required-behavior claim, required-effect claim, capability gap, functional-behavior slot, or candidate-allocation question with its subject pattern. |
| transformer-side filler and candidate bearer | For a design-only candidate, keep the candidate transformer-side system locus or candidate `U.System` reference without asserting an assignment or performed Work. If the local kind `TransformerSystemRole` is current, name that kind; add a separate judgment classifying a System under it only when that judgment obtains. If an assignment is independently current, recover its directly declared species and its obtaining occurrence with actual participant values, holder, applicability, and extent under A.2.1. If performed Work is independently current, point to its basis: A.13 first, independent A.15.1 Work admission second, and F.6 afterward only for precise assignment-bound attribution. Coordinate the selected locus with `A.3.4 TransformerRef?`, `A.7`, `A.15`, `A.15.1`, and `A.15.2` only for the claims that are actually current. | A `FunctionalElementClaim` may cite an independently established candidate-bearer locus, but that citation is not the whole transformer ontology. A kind, classification judgment, assignment species, assignment occurrence, and dated Work are independent facts; none manufactures another. |
| input condition, output condition, and functional ports | `A.3.4 InputConditionRefs?`, `OutputConditionRefs?`, and `FunctionalPortRefs?`; `U.Signature` discipline through `A.6.0` and `A.6.5` when accepted or produced states, media, flows, signals, information, work products, formal objects, or functional port signatures matter | A functional port is not automatically a module interface. Use A.6.M only when module-interface or substitution compatibility is the claim. |
| capability of a holon | the exact `U.Capability` value or capability claim under its subject pattern | Does not imply that a method, module, work occurrence, or successful transformation exists. |
| method or algorithm wording | `U.Method` only when the claim concerns a reusable semantic way of doing; `U.MethodDescription` only for an already identified `U.Episteme` that passes the A.3.2 guard above: one admitted `U.Method` is its exact `EntityOfConcern` and at least one claim says how that method is done | Procedure, code, solver, recipe, protocol, and algorithm forms are clues only; they establish neither membership, execution, nor evidence. |
| mechanism wording | `U.Mechanism` through `A.6.1` and `E.20` when a law-governed realization or operation structure is the claim | Does not become a method, Work occurrence, capability, selected functional structure, or functional-view claim by label. |
| work plan, work occurrence, or work result | Recover the exact `U.WorkPlan` under `A.15.2`, one exact dated `W : U.Work` under `A.15.1`, or the separately identified result entity or episteme together with the predicate that relates it to the current Work or application. Use `A.15.PROD` when production, entity inception, or production completion is current, and `A.6.RCD` only when the needed direct result relation has no current governor. | A plan, Work occurrence, and result are different objects. None implies reusable function ontology or completed functioning, and a result is not part of Work identity. |
| system-role or responsibility wording | `VP.AllocationResponsibility` is only a recognition cue. A positive responsibility claim names an admitted domain responsibility predicate, its actual participants, applicability, and occurrence identity; otherwise return the exact `A.6.RCD` missing governor. If an assignment claim is also current, recover its directly declared species and obtaining occurrence under A.2.1. If performed Work is current, point to its basis: A.13 first, independent A.15.1 Work admission second, and F.6 afterward only for precise assignment-bound attribution. | A system-role kind, classification judgment, assignment, function phrase, commitment, position, authority label, or Work attribution establishes no responsibility relation by form. Responsibility may obtain with or without a commitment, and each relation keeps its own predicate and identity. |
| participation or actual functioning | Name the direct domain predicate, actual participants, applicability, and occurrence identity for the claimed participation or functioning. If the corpus has no such predicate for the receiving use, return the exact `A.6.RCD` missing governor. | Assignment, capability, allocation, nearby Work, or a function label does not make participation or actual functioning obtain. |
| mathematical function or relation | C.29 mathematical-lens use with domain, codomain or relation domain, preserved and lost structure, lens-use admissibility value, and stop condition | Does not become architecture, evidence, causal proof, assurance, or decision claim by itself. |
| quality or fitness expression | `C.25`, `C.16`, `C.16.Q`, `A.17`, `A.18`, or an admitted characteristic or measurement subject pattern according to the claim being made | Does not let "functionality" carry a quality claim without bearer and subject pattern. |
| module allocation | Recover the exact allocation or correspondence claim or relation under its subject pattern. When a functional view cites it, use `FunctionalStructureViewUse` with its `ArchitectureStructuralView` and the exact claim or relation reference; use `A.6.M` when a module-interface claim is being made. | Does not make function and module one FPF kind. One selected functional structure may have allocation claims involving several modules, one module may occur in claims about several functional structures, and a module may have no current functional-view claim. |
| interface relation, module-interface relation, or signature relation | Use `A.6.RSIR` first when bare interface, API, port, protocol, or service-access wording could point to several direct EoCs; then use `A.6.M` for the module-interface boundary and `A.6.0` and `A.6.5` for signature discipline, with `A.6.B`, `A.6.C`, or `A.6.P:4.11a` only when that boundary, interface condition, API, protocol, service, promise, or duty claim is being made | Does not turn a functional link, port label, API name, or signature into implemented compatibility. |
| evidence, result, assurance, gate, decision, or publication claim | the direct evidence, result, assurance, gate, decision, publication, or source pattern named by value | Function wording can point to these claims, but it does not authorize or prove them by itself. |
| functional architecture | `ArchitectureOf@Context` whose `structureKindRefs` includes `FunctionalStructure`, one selected functional `U.Structure`, and the `ArchitectureStructuralView` episteme about that structure. Use `FunctionalStructureViewUse` only when citations to exact `FunctionalElementClaim` epistemes or other separately established values change action. | Not a peer architecture ontology, functional-element individual, selected transformation-flow structure, or mathematical graph description by itself. |

**Required-versus-actual check.** “The cooling loop shall reduce outlet temperature by 8 °C within 60 seconds” remains a requirement or functional-view claim; by itself it identifies no `U.Transformation`. If a later run actually changes the loop state, identify that cooling occurrence separately under A.3.4 from the changed loop, exact boundary and conditions, actual before/during/after facts, and continuity or reidentification rule. Requirement-only material is the countercase and stop: it cannot admit an actual transformation, observed functioning, or evidence of success.

#### A.6.F:4.4 - Functional architecture boundary

Functional architecture is the `FunctionalStructure` case of `ArchitectureOf@Context`: the declared organization used to relate one selected functional structure to independently established claims about required behavior or effects, capabilities, functional dependencies, and constraints that a holon is to realize, before or alongside allocation to modules, local system-role kinds or assignments, work, evidence, control relations, selected transformation-flow structures, or mathematical descriptions of those structures. Under C.30.ASV, the view is an `ArchitectureStructuralView` episteme whose `EntityOfConcern` is that selected structure; it does not define a functional-element individual. A `FunctionalStructureViewUse` may cite exact `FunctionalElementClaim` epistemes and other separately established values needed by the use.

```text
Functional architecture shorthand:
  open the `ArchitectureOf@Context` form in the current C.30 edition;
  name the exact described holon and select one functional `U.Structure`;
  use the `ArchitectureStructuralView` episteme whose `EntityOfConcern` is that structure and whose exact viewpoint conformance obtains;
  add `FunctionalStructureViewUse` only when exact `FunctionalElementClaim` epistemes or other separately established values change action;
  require an independent A.3.4 basis for every actual-transformation reference;
  fill every other C.30 field required by this architecture use.
```
The view keeps requirement, required-behavior/effect, capability, dependency, and constraint claims with their subject patterns; their wording does not turn them into `U.StructureRef` values or actual transformations. An actual-transformation reference is admissible only after A.3.4 independently grounds the occurrence. A selected `TransformationFlowStructure`, path slice, crossing, flow valuation, or mathematical description may be related to functional structure through `C.30.TFS-REL`, `E.18`, or `E.18.2`, but it is neither the required effect nor the functional architecture itself unless the positive selected-structure co-reference check succeeds.

#### A.6.F:4.5 - Function-flow-module alignment note

Recover the local alignment when functional wording touches flow or module allocation but does not yet require a full structural view or `A.6.M` module-relation repair. Use this note only when the receiving use needs an inspectable alignment record; otherwise state the recovered alignment and boundary in the repaired wording.

```text
FunctionFlowModuleAlignmentNote:
required function or effect:
flow path or dependency:
proposed module allocation:
separateNeighborClaims:
known mismatch:
subjectPatternApplicationRefs:
admissible use:
non-admissible use?:
```

The note records only the local function-flow-module alignment and boundary. Its explanatory non-admissible-use guard is optional under the full F.19:4 test and needs no absence entry when unused. Functional architecture, module relation, implemented-interface, evidence-sufficiency, and architecture-decision claims remain with their subject patterns.

#### A.6.F:4.6 - Common kind and relation separations

| Confusion | Repair |
| --- | --- |
| function = module | Keep `VP.Functional` and `VP.ModuleInterface` distinct; connect them through declared correspondence, allocation, retargeting, or `A.6.M` module-relation repair. |
| function = capability | Capability belongs to a holon. Keep a required or desired behavior/effect as claim content under its requirement, architecture, capability-gap, functional-view, method, or other subject pattern; neither that claim nor the capability establishes an actual transformation. |
| function = work | One `W : U.Work` is a dated world-side occurrence. Its result or output is a separately identified entity or episteme. Connect it only through the subject-specific direct result or production relation that actually obtains, or use one local `A.15.PROD` claim for the current production-work, inception, or completion question. Use `A.6.RCD` only when a needed relation has no current governor. Function wording remains design-side or description-side content unless an exact work-facing claim is current. |
| function = method | Method is a reusable way of doing. A method claim may state an intended effect, but that effect is neither the method nor an actual `U.Transformation`; apply A.3.4 only when the actual change occurrence is independently grounded. |
| function = system-role kind, assignment, participation, functioning, or responsibility | Recover only the branch the sentence asserts. A system-role kind is a local `...SystemRole` kind; an assignment is one occurrence and its declared `U.SystemRoleAssignment` species; performed Work uses F.6 separately; participation, functioning, and responsibility each need their domain predicate or an `A.6.RCD` missing governor. |
| mathematical function = holon purpose | Use C.29 for mathematical function or relation; recover domain, codomain or relation domain, preserved and lost structure, lens-use admissibility value, and stop condition. |
| functional diagram = evidence | Diagram is a view or publication; evidence claim uses `A.10` or `G.6`. |
| functionality = quality | Recover the quality bearer and subject pattern through `C.25`, `C.16`, or C.16.Q before using the wording as an adequacy claim. |

#### A.6.F:4.7 - Composability and compositionality

Composability and quality compositionality are separate claims. If the text says parts can be assembled, keep that as a structure or use claim. If it says a quality of the whole follows from parts, assign the quality-composition claim to `C.25` and C.16-backed measurement or quality claim:

```text
Composability:
  exactGovernedObjectOrClaim: the A.6.M `ModuleInterfaceClaim` content for "A and B can be assembled under interface X"
  selectedClaimBearingEpistemeUse: the exact C.2.1 episteme carrying that claim content
  directRelationPredicateUse?: only an exact domain predicate independently admitted for a direct module-allocation or module-interface relation, with its actual participants
  relationalAssertionUse?: the exact C.2.1 episteme that affirms, denies, or modalizes that admitted predicate, only when such a predicate is current
  obtainingRelationOccurrenceUse?: only when that admitted relation has a same-versus-new-occurrence rule and the receiving use must distinguish one obtaining occurrence through A.6.REL
  reusableDeclarationUse?: one compatible RelationSignature and its declaration-local SlotSpecs, only when repeated typed use needs them
  subjectPatternApplicationRefs: A.6.M for `ModuleInterfaceClaim`; C.2.1 for its claim-bearing episteme; A.6.RCD when a reusable direct relation is needed but absent; A.6.REL only after the direct relation is admitted and one obtaining occurrence must be distinguished; A.6.0 and A.6.5 only for the reusable declaration
Quality compositionality:
  exactGovernedObjectOrClaim: the affected Q-Bundle and the exact structural-characteristic, causal-hypothesis, or evidence-relation claim that this use relies on
  directRelationPredicateUse?: the exact predicate defined or tested through C.16, C.16.Q, or A.10 and its actual participants, only when that relation is current
  relationalAssertionUse?: the exact C.2.1 episteme and its affirmative, negative, or modal quality or evidence claim when that assertion is current
  subjectPatternApplicationRefs: C.25; C.16 or C.16.Q; A.10 only when evidence provenance is the claim being made
Non-admissible:
  successful assembly is not quality propagation
```
Compositional formalisms may express explicit composition structures and view or model relations. They do not make safety, latency, reliability, or another quality propagate automatically.

A.6.F defines no separate quality-composition record. Use the claim form supplied by the applicable subject pattern. A composite family uses the exact C.25 Q-Bundle, including its bearer, scope, measures, qualification window, mechanisms or status, and evidence. A single characteristic or measurement follows C.16, with C.16.Q used only when quality wording still needs repair; name its bearer, scope, measure, and claim identity. Keep a causal inference with its causal pattern, and use A.10 only when evidence provenance is the claim being made. If those values cannot be named, keep the quality-composition claim unresolved rather than filling an A.6.F-only schema.

#### A.6.F:4.8 - Worked slices

**Function-like module claim; no direct relation.** A release note says, “The brake-control functional package is in the vehicle-control system.” The head noun is `package`; do not turn the modifier `functional` into `U.Function`. For this use, recover this concrete result:

- `exactGovernedObjectOrClaim`: A.6.M `ModuleInterfaceClaim` content naming `BrakeControllerPackage`, `VehicleControlSystem`, `Release-2026Q2`, `VP.ModuleInterface`, `BrakeControlBoundary`, and an `interfaceSpecificationRef` that resolves `BrakeControlInterfaceSpec-v5`; its direct-relation disposition is `noDirectRelationClaimed`;
- `selectedClaimBearingEpistemeUse`: `BrakeArchitectureNote_v3 : U.Episteme` under C.2.1 carries that content and has `BrakeControllerPackage` as its exact `EntityOfConcern`;
- `directRelationPredicateUse`, `relationalAssertionUse`, and `obtainingRelationOccurrenceUse`: `not used`, because no domain rule has admitted a direct module relation predicate or an obtaining occurrence for this case;
- remaining action: apply A.6.M to the declared interface and admissibility conditions; do not infer a function allocation, direct relation, or implemented compatibility from the source phrase.

**Interrupted assignment; occurrence identity needed.** A maintenance log says, “Robot-7 resumed its inspection function after a documented period with no inspection assignment.” Treat `function` as a cue. Recover `InspectorSystemRole` and one declared direct species `CellInspectorAssignment <: U.SystemRoleAssignment`; then test its direct predicate for `Robot-7 : U.System` and the species-specific cell and interval participants. Keep `Robot7AssignmentLog_42` as the separate C.2.1 episteme that states the interval facts. A.2.1 says that the demonstrated non-assignment period ends the first assignment occurrence and the later resumption begins another. When the maintenance history must distinguish them, apply A.6.REL with that identity rule to keep `InspectorAssignment_PreGap` and `InspectorAssignment_PostGap` distinct. A taxonomy or scheme is not an assignment participant, and neither assignment implies inspection Work.

**Neighbor claims that need their own relation.**

- `TestArticle-7 participates passively in TestWork-9 during TestInterval-9` is not established by `TestArticleSystemRole` or `TestArticleAssignment-7`. Until a direct passive-test-participation predicate supplies participant order and identity, return `A.6.RCD missing-governor[direct passive-test-participation relation]`; the tester's Work and F.6 attribution remain usable.
- `Motor-M1 drives PumpAssembly-A during PumpRun-17` needs a direct motor-drive-functioning predicate. Assignment, torque capability, and pumping Work remain separate; without that predicate return `A.6.RCD missing-governor[direct motor-drive-functioning relation]`.
- `Hammer-3 supports PaperStack-9 during Interval-P` needs a direct artifact-support predicate. Do not replace that exact claim with an interchangeable list of use, load, support, or function kinds; without the predicate return `A.6.RCD missing-governor[direct artifact-support relation]`.

**Functional architecture phrase.** A team says, "the functional architecture is the user journey." A.6.F does not let the phrase create a separate architecture kind. For a receiving use that needs inspectable detail, the repair can be recorded as:

```text
FunctionUseRepair:
phrase: "functional architecture"
functionLikeReadingUnderRepair: functionalArchitecture
exactGovernedObjectOrClaim: the `ArchitectureOf@Context` claim record and its one selected functional `U.Structure`
selectedClaimBearingEpistemeUse: the exact `ArchitectureStructuralView` episteme whose `EntityOfConcern` is that structure, plus any exact C.2.1 `FunctionalElementClaim` epistemes cited by the use
subjectPatternApplicationRefs: C.30; C.30.ASV
blockedLocalOverreadRefs: the source claim "the functional architecture is the user journey"
nextAdmissibleUse: when the view changes action, use `FunctionalStructureViewUse` to cite the view, exact claim epistemes, and only separately established bearer, capability, port, allocation, or correspondence values
stopCondition: ordinary phrasing remains Plain when no architecture claim is made; requirement-only material remains a claim; an actual transformation appears only on an independent A.3.4 basis
```
**Functionality as quality.** A product note says, "new functionality improves adequacy." The repair separates the exact added-capability or required-effect claim from the quality claim. Capability or effect wording may stay as recognition, but the adequacy claim goes to `C.25`, `C.16`, C.16.Q, or the admitted characteristic or measurement pattern that states its bearer and criterion. A.6.F stops once those exact claims and subject patterns are clear; it adds no reusable declaration, view, or representation apparatus unless the receiving use actually needs it.

**Mathematical function or loss.** A model note says, "the loss function explains the holon purpose." The repair keeps the mathematical function under C.29 lens discipline: domain, codomain or relation domain, preserved and lost structure, lens-use admissibility value, and stop condition. The loss may inform a reasoning move; it does not become holon purpose, evidence sufficiency, causal proof, assurance, or project decision by itself.

**Pump-station functional dependency.** A maintenance note says, "the backup pump function is degraded." A.6.F first separates the required effect, the exact `U.Capability` value or capability claim, the physical module allocation, the performed maintenance work, the evidence relation, and the quality claim. The functional wording may open a `FunctionalStructure` view under C.30.ASV or go to the capability pattern; it does not by itself prove the pump was tested, authorize operation, or make the backup module compatible with the main line.

**Product-platform allocation.** A hardware team says, "thermal management functionality moved to the chassis." The repair separates required heat-removal effect, module allocation, interface constraints, signature constraints, architecture structural view, and any evidence or gate claim. A.6.F keeps the function-like wording useful for architecture work while sending module-interface and evidence claims to their subject patterns.

### A.6.F:5 - Archetypal Grounding

| Tell-Show-Show row | Grounding |
| --- | --- |
| Tell | A practitioner reads “the function”, “functional architecture”, or “this functionality” and needs to know whether the sentence is about capability, effect, method, Work, a system-role kind or assignment, participation, actual functioning, responsibility, module allocation, mathematical relation, quality, or architecture. A.6.F asks for the exact object or claim and its subject pattern before the phrase carries an FPF claim. |
| Show: `U.System` | A robot, software system, plant, product platform, or AI-agent system may have capabilities, required effects, control functions, module allocations, runtime flows, and user-visible functionality. Those are not one FPF object; A.6.F identifies the exact entity, value, claim, episteme, or direct relation current in each use and requires its subject pattern for it. |
| Show: `U.Episteme` — method-description case | An algorithm file is not automatically a method description. It passes the A.3.2 membership test only when one identified claim-bearing episteme has one admitted exact `U.Method` as its `EntityOfConcern` and says substantively how that method is done. File form, name, author, citation, approval, or executability alone is the near-miss; stop at the direct representation, publication, form, carrier, or other current pattern. |
| Show: `U.Episteme` — other function-like claims | A functional diagram, modeling-language view, architecture view or note, generated-code architecture note, benchmark report, or mathematical model may cue a claim-bearing episteme; a publication form can express its selected edition and a publication occurrence can make that edition available. Read the claim before the form: use C.30 for architecture and view claims, C.30.ASV for structural-view claims, and the pattern that defines any required representation correspondence; keep a benchmark report as an episteme and publication rather than evidence or a method description, and require an exact A.10 or G.6 evidence relation before using it as support; use its subject pattern for a mathematical or formal claim and use C.29 when a mathematical-lens use is current. Neither the episteme, publication occurrence, form, carrier, nor correspondence becomes the function, capability, Work, evidence relation, architecture, or mathematical object by its form. |

### A.6.F:6 - Bias-Annotation

Lenses tested: **Arch**, **Ontology and episteme**, **Prag**, **Did**, **Gov**. Scope: function-like wording that carries an FPF claim being made across FPF.

| Bias risk | Mitigation |
| --- | --- |
| Function-root bias | The pattern explicitly does not mint `U.Function`; it requires the subject pattern for the exact object or claim. |
| Functional-architecture exception bias | Functional architecture is normalized as `FunctionalStructure`, not a peer ontology. |
| Module bias | Function-to-module allocation uses correspondence or `A.6.M` module-relation repair; function and module remain distinct. |
| Mathematical bias | Mathematical function wording is assigned to C.29 when used as a lens. |
| Check-only bias | Every conformance item carries a repair action or subject-pattern application. |

This checklist verifies the preceding guidance after the practitioner has chosen the selected repair action; it is not a required project control form and not a substitute for the card, note, view, relation, or repair guidance above.

### A.6.F:7 - Conformance Checklist

| ID | Requirement | Failed-check repair |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **CC-A6F-1 Exact object or claim.** | Every function-like phrase that carries an FPF claim names its subject pattern and at least one exact entity or value, claim or claim content, or claim-bearing episteme. When a direct relation is current, the admitted kind and semantic predicate are distinguished from the `C.2.1` relational-assertion episteme and from any separately individuated obtaining occurrence; each current branch names its actual participants, and neither a predicate nor an assertion supplies occurrence identity. A reusable declaration appears only when typed reuse is current; another selected assertion, specification, or view appears only when that claim-bearing episteme is current; representation correspondence appears only when representation is current. | Complete the object-or-claim distinction in the wording or demote the phrase to Plain prose; use `FunctionUseRepair` only when its inspectable detail is needed. |
| **CC-A6F-2 No `U.Function`.** | The use does not mint or rely on `U.Function` as a new root kind. | Assign the use to a functional view, capability, method, Work, exact system-role kind or assignment, direct participation, functioning, or responsibility predicate, mathematical lens, quality or characteristic, module allocation, or another subject pattern. |
| **CC-A6F-3 Functional architecture expansion.** | Functional architecture expands to an `ArchitectureOf@Context` claim record with one selected functional `U.Structure`. When the view changes action, use the `ArchitectureStructuralView` episteme whose `EntityOfConcern` is that structure and a `FunctionalStructureViewUse` that cites exact `FunctionalElementClaim` epistemes and only separately established values. No label or `@Context` suffix creates a functional-element individual or fills a claim. | Add the exact claim record, selected structure, view episteme, and any needed claim references; otherwise keep the phrase as ordinary recognition wording. |
| **CC-A6F-4 Function and capability split.** | Capability claims and function or effect claims remain distinct. | State the exact `U.Capability` value or capability claim under its subject predicate, using the subject pattern only as a locator, and keep the required behavior or effect claim with its requirement, functional view, method, or other exact claim-bearing source. |
| **CC-A6F-4A Required-effect and actual-change split.** | A required or desired behavior/effect remains claim content; every `U.Transformation` reference has an independent A.3.4 occurrence basis. | If only requirement, architecture, method, desired-effect, diagram, or assertion material is available, stop before `U.Transformation`. If an actual change is current, identify its changed referent, boundary, conditions, actual facts, and continuity or reidentification rule separately. |
| **CC-A6F-5 Function, work, and method-description split.** | Method, `U.MethodDescription` membership, work occurrence, and work result claims do not hide inside function wording; source form does not establish membership. | For a reusable way-of-doing claim, recover the exact `U.Method` under A.3.1. For `U.MethodDescription`, first identify the C.2.1 episteme, its exact admitted `U.Method` as `EntityOfConcern`, and at least one substantive way-of-doing claim under A.3.2. Otherwise use the direct plan, work, result, representation, publication, or other pattern. |
| **CC-A6F-6 Function and neighboring relations split.** | Local system-role kind, System-classification judgment, assignment species, assignment occurrence, participation, actual functioning, responsibility, Work, and capability remain separate. `VP.AllocationResponsibility` is only a recognition cue. | Name each current fact independently. An assignment needs both its directly declared species and obtaining occurrence under A.2.1; actual Work points to its basis: A.13 first, independent A.15.1 Work admission second, and F.6 afterward only for precise assignment-bound attribution. Name an admitted domain predicate and actual participants for participation, functioning, or responsibility, or return the exact A.6.RCD missing governor. |
| **CC-A6F-7 Mathematical function boundary.** | Mathematical function or relation wording used to justify reasoning names C.29 lens fields and stop condition. | Add C.29 lens-use admissibility value, preserved and lost structure, and stop condition, or mark mathematical use as ordinary. |
| **CC-A6F-8 Quality and functionality boundary.** | Quality, fitness, characteristic, score, or "functionality" wording recovers bearer and subject pattern. | Assign the claim to `C.25`, `C.16`, `C.16.Q`, `A.17`, `A.18`, or the characteristic named by value or measurement subject pattern according to the asserted quality, characteristic, measurement, or comparison claim. |
| **CC-A6F-9 Module-interface boundary.** | Functional relation, module allocation, interface, signature, port, API, protocol, flow, and mechanism wording remain separated. | Add `A.6.RSIR` interface-cue recovery, `FunctionFlowModuleAlignmentNote`, the `A.6.M` module-interface boundary, the `A.6.0` and `A.6.5` signature discipline, declared correspondence, declared allocation, or `A.6.M` module-relation repair. |
| **CC-A6F-10 Useful action.** | The repair leaves a remaining admissible use: apply the subject pattern to the exact object or claim; open a functional view; add an alignment note; add the admitted direct-relation predicate, relational assertion, separately individuated obtaining occurrence, reusable declaration, selected claim-bearing episteme, or representation correspondence only for a named use; assign the claim to C.29, C.30, C.30.ASV, A.15, C.25, C.16, A.10, B.3, A.20, A.21, or C.11; or stop. | Restore that use, or classify the phrase as reduced-use cue, quote-only wording, blocked transfer, or incomplete rewrite. |

### A.6.F:8 - Common Anti-Patterns and How to Avoid Them

| Anti-pattern | Symptom | Repair |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Root function kind** | The text treats function as a new universal FPF kind. | Name the exact object or claim and apply its subject pattern; use the optional `FunctionUseRepair` when the receiving use needs that record. |
| **Functional architecture exception** | Functional architecture is treated as a peer architecture ontology. | Expand to `FunctionalStructure` under `ArchitectureOf@Context` and C.30.ASV. |
| **Capability collapse** | What the holon can do is treated as a functional dependency or vice versa. | Split capability claim from functional relation or effect claim. |
| **Work collapse** | Work occurrence or result is described as a function. | Assign occurrence or result claims to A.15 and P2W and keep functional wording design-side unless a work-evidence claim is being made. |
| **Algorithm-form shortcut** | Procedure, code, solver, recipe, protocol, or algorithm form is treated as proof of `U.MethodDescription` membership. | Recover the claim-bearing C.2.1 episteme, one admitted `U.Method` as its exact `EntityOfConcern`, and at least one substantive way-of-doing claim under A.3.2; otherwise keep the source form with its subject pattern. |
| **Mathematical-function import** | A mathematical function, loss, objective, or value functional becomes design ontology. | Use C.29 and state preserved and lost structure plus stop condition. |
| **Module allocation shortcut** | A function is considered implemented because a module is named. | Add correspondence, allocation, module-interface boundary, signature-discipline boundary, or `A.6.M` module-relation repair. |
| **Functionality as quality proxy** | "Functionality" carries adequacy or quality claim without bearer and subject pattern. | Recover bearer and subject pattern through `C.25`, `C.16`, C.16.Q, or an admitted characteristic or measurement subject pattern. |
| **Sterile kind repair** | The wording is typed but no useful move remains. | Restore the direct action on the exact object or claim: use the pattern that defines or tests it, open the selected view, add the needed alignment or correspondence, or stop the stronger reading. |

### A.6.F:9 - Consequences

| Benefit | Cost or trade-off |
| --- | --- |
| Function-like prose remains usable without minting `U.Function`. | Claim-bearing uses must name the exact object or claim and subject pattern; additional relation, declaration, assertion, specification, view, or representation objects appear only for a named use. |
| Functional architecture becomes a normal architecture-by-structure-kind case. | C.30 or C.30.ASV may be needed when the phrase carries an architecture claim. |
| Capability, method, Work, system-role kind, assignment, participation, functioning, responsibility, mathematical, quality, module, and interface claims stay separable. | One familiar word may require several independently established objects or claims when several readings are current. |
| C.29, C.25, C.16, A.15, C.30, and `A.6.M` govern only the claims that belong to them. | A conforming use stops once the exact object or claim, subject pattern, and remaining action are clear instead of opening all possible subject patterns. |

### A.6.F:10 - Rationale

Function-like wording is too useful to ban and too overloaded to leave unresolved. The smallest useful repair is not a new ontology or a generic record. Name the exact entity, value, claim, or claim-bearing episteme, apply its subject pattern, and state the remaining use. Add an explanatory rejected reading only under the full F.19:4 test.

This design follows A.6.P: recover the direct relation and actual participants when one obtains; add a reusable `RelationSignature` and declaration-local `SlotSpec`s only for typed reuse; keep assertion, specification, or view epistemes separate; and keep representation elements under C.29 with explicit correspondence. It also follows C.30: functional architecture is selected structure for a described holon, not a peer of architecture, not a selected transformation-flow structure by default, and not a mathematical graph description by itself.

The pattern keeps ordinary language usable. A phrase can remain Plain when it carries no FPF claim. When it carries an ontological, evidence, causal, assurance, bridge, gate, work, decision, or admissibility claim, the exact object or claim and subject pattern are recoverable. No generic relation, claim, slot, or view record stands in for that result.

### A.6.F:11 - SoTA-Echoing

| Practice or source line | A.6.F adoption | Action consequence | Boundary |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ISO/IEC/IEEE 42010:2022 architecture-description discipline | Adapt view and concern discipline to functional architecture as a structure-kind view over an architecture claim. | Functional architecture expands through C.30 and C.30.ASV rather than becoming a separate ontology. | ISO terminology does not mint `U.Function` or turn diagrams into architecture. |
| Deliberate exclusion — SysML v2 and its UML-lineage modeling practice | Do not use it as the SoTA basis for this pattern; its popularity and search visibility do not establish present engineering advantage for this problem. | No A.6.F rule or example depends on SysML model elements. More useful domain languages may still supply bounded comparison evidence under their own current source-use record. | This is an explicit non-lineage boundary: SysML terminology and diagram practice do not define FPF kinds, relations, subject patterns, or functional-view adequacy. |
| INCOSE systems-engineering and MBSE functional-analysis practice | Adopt the practical need to separate function, requirement, behavior, physical allocation, and verification claims. | A function-like phrase can guide architecture work only after capability or effect, allocation, evidence, and verification claims are separated. | Functional analysis practice is not evidence sufficiency, assurance, gate passage, or project decision by itself. |
| ISO/IEC 25010 quality-model practice | Treat functionality or functional suitability as quality wording when it evaluates a product or service. | Assign quality-like uses to C.25, C.16, or C.16.Q before they carry adequacy claims. | "Functionality" is not a free adequacy score and not an `ArchitectureOf@Context` claim or selected functional view. |
| C.29 mathematical-lens discipline | Adopt domain, codomain or relation-domain, preserved and lost structure, lens-use admissibility value, and stop condition for mathematical function use. | Mathematical function wording enters a C.29 lens claim only when its fields are recoverable. | Mathematical functions, objectives, and value functionals do not become holon purpose, evidence, causal proof, assurance, or decision claim by themselves. |
| GonzoML neural-network architecture discussions | Adapt practitioner operation language involving blocks, activations, path-selection, memory, cache, loss functions, pruning, ablation, and architecture search as recognition material. | Function-like neural-network wording must resolve to the exact mathematical object, flow relation, module-interface claim, capability or effect, quality characteristic, decision, or evidence claim and its subject pattern. | Neural-network labels and benchmark results do not become FPF ontology, architecture decision, evidence sufficiency, gate passage, or assurance by themselves. |
