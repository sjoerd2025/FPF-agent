## E.2 - The Eleven Pillars

### E.2:1 - Problem frame
Pattern E.1 set the FPF mission as an **operating system for thought**. To turn that mission into a durable architecture, FPF needs a small, explicit constitution - principles that remain stable while everything built on top of them can evolve. Without such invariants, domain silos, vocabulary drift, and tool-centric shortcuts quickly erode coherence and reproducibility across disciplines.

The pillars are also the first-principles basis of FPF. They are the minimal commitments from which pattern-level work derives: decisive structure, teachability, maturing formality, open kernel, layering, register discipline, practical payoff, cross-scale consistency, explicit state, open-ended evolution, and SoTA renewal. Later patterns can support this basis by making a concrete argument about pillar support more inspectable; they do not replace pillar authority.

### E.2:2 - Problem
Frameworks without binding first principles wobble between two extremes: rigid dogmas that kill adaptation and amorphous guidelines that invite cognitive chaos. In either case, reasoning fragments, auditability collapses, and physical impact suffers.

### E.2:3 - Forces
| Force                          | Tension                                                |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Foundational Stability**     | Immutable core ↔ perpetual adaptation to new knowledge |
| **Cognitive Load**             | Minimal elegance ↔ comprehensive coverage              |
| **Rigor vs Accessibility**     | Formal soundness ↔ intuitive entry for non‑specialists |
| **Universality vs Modularity** | Domain‑agnostic scope ↔ plug‑in extensibility          |
| **Pragmatic Grounding**        | Abstract invariants ↔ measurable, falsifiable outcomes |

### E.2:4 - Solution
FPF rests on **eleven non‑negotiable pillars**. Each pillar is a binding constraint that every artefact, pattern, and design‑rationale record (DRR) **must** honour. Together they form the load‑bearing structure that guarantees evolvability, cross‑scale coherence, and didactic clarity.

| ID       | Pillar                         | Essence                                                                                                                   |
| -------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **P‑1**  | **Cognitive Elegance**         | Highlight decisive structure, eliminate ornamental formalism; separate data governance from thinking.                     |
| **P‑2**  | **Didactic Primacy**           | Human comprehension outranks theoretical or tooling purity.                                                               |
| **P‑3**  | **Scalable Formality**         | A single artefact can mature step‑by‑step from informal guess to formally assured state without forks or rewrites.        |
| **P‑4**  | **Open‑Ended Kernel**          | The Kernel contains only meta‑concepts; all domain knowledge lives in external patterns.                       |
| **P‑5**  | **FPF Layering**           | Patterns are modular, declarative extensions that can be added, replaced, or removed without destabilising the core. |
| **P-6**  | **Lexical Stratification**     | Every core concept is expressible in four registers: plain name, technical term, admitted U-kind or governed value name, and mathematical symbol.  |
| **P‑7**  | **Pragmatic Utility**          | Proofs, metrics, and models exist to achieve real‑world objectives; falsification is rewarded over confirmation.          |
| **P‑8**  | **Cross‑Scale Consistency**    | Composition algebras (aggregation, boundary, emergence) are invariant across material systems, knowledge, and methods.    |
| **P‑9**  | **State Explicitness**         | Every artefact declares its state (`design‑time`, `run‑time`, etc.); transitions are cheap, traceable, auditable.         |
| **P‑10** | **Open‑Ended Evolution**       | Every entity is expected to evolve indefinitely; cycles must remain cheap, safe, and cognitively rewarding.               |
| **P‑11** | **State‑of‑the‑Art Alignment** | The kernel and extension domain-specific patterns track reliable contemporary knowledge and update when the SoTA advances.                     |

When a pillar-impact argument relies on mathematical structure, scale behavior, optimization, uncertainty, invariance, obstruction, or other first-principles modeling support, the applicable mathematical-lens use support path is `C.29`. The pillar claim remains governed by `E.2`; `C.29` only states the mathematical lens, preserved and lost structure, admissible use, neighboring-pattern exits, and stop condition that make the pillar support inspectable.

> Any DRR that contradicts a pillar must first amend this constitutional pattern.

| ID         | Requirement                                                                                                                       | Purpose                               |
| ---------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **CC‑P‑1** | Every architectural pattern **must** list which pillar(s) it instantiates or refines.                                             | Guarantees constitutional grounding.  |
| **CC‑P‑2** | Every DRR proposing a normative change **must** include a “Pillar Impact Analysis.”                                               | Makes constitutional review explicit. |
| **CC‑P‑3** | Tooling and pedagogical artefacts **should** document which pillar(s) shape their design.                                         | Upholds P‑2 (Didactic Primacy).       |
| **CC‑P‑4** | A pattern is conformant only if its invariants reference **≥ 3** pillars, demonstrating cross‑scale and pragmatic alignment. | Prevents narrow, siloed extensions.   |
| **CC‑P‑5** | When two lawful approaches exist, authors **SHOULD** prefer methods whose **empirical capability slope** is **non‑negative** over the **audited scale window** (data, compute, **freedom‑of‑action**) and **MUST** justify any exception **via** a **BLP Scale‑Audit** (**BLP‑1**) with **declared tolerances** *(α = budget; δ = assurance; units specified)*. | Embeds Bitter‑Lesson preference; curbs heuristic debt. |
| **CC‑P‑6** | A pillar-impact analysis that relies on mathematical structure, scale behavior, optimization, uncertainty, invariance, obstruction, or other first-principles modeling support is complete only when that support is ordinary accepted local theory, a cited `C.29` output, or a named neighboring-pattern output for evidence, causal, bridge, assurance, measurement, work, decision, publication, or admission claims. | Keeps mathematical support for pillars inspectable without letting `C.29` revise pillar authority. |

### E.2:6 - Policy — Bitter‑Lesson Preference (BLP)

**Intent.** Favor **general, computation‑leveraged**, and **freedom‑of‑action** methods over hand‑tuned, brittle heuristics *when safety and legality are held constant*. This codifies the empirical trend that methods which scale with **data, compute, and search breadth** outpace bespoke rule‑engineering. **Applicability:** beyond ML, this policy covers **search/optimization**, **control**, **simulation‑based inference**, and other computational sciences where capability improves with scale and exploration. When **NQD/E/E‑LOG** promotes **novelty/coverage (illumination)** telemetry into dominance (via an explicit **CAL** policy; **policy‑id recorded in SCR**), these telemetry metrics are included in BLP comparisons for the audited window.

**BLP‑1 — Scale‑Audit Requirement.** Any DRR that selects a more specialized/hand‑engineered method over a general/scalable alternative **MUST** include a **Scale‑Audit**:
* (a) **Parity harness**: same **ComparatorSet**, **freshness window**, and **evaluation seeds/replicates**; set-returning evaluation (see **G.5/G.9**). Dominance criterion: **Pareto‑only** by default across the declared objective vector; any alternative requires a documented waiver by **Gov‑CAL** under **E.3** precedence.
* (b) **Budgets**: sweep **compute** (**steps/tokens/params/time/energy**, as applicable), **data** (size/quality), and **freedom‑of‑action** (from script‑like instructions → minimal prohibitions) **under a fixed risk/safety envelope**. If any parameter cannot be swept, **pin** it and record the invariant.
* (c) **Slopes & uncertainty**: report ∂quality/∂compute, ∂quality/∂data, and (where applicable) ∂coverage/∂**freedom‑of‑action** and **∂novelty/∂budget**; include **error bars/CI** from multi‑seed trials; publish edition pins and policy‑IDs in SCR/telemetry (**G.11**).
* (d) **Resources**: publish resource accounts for time/energy/FLOPs through **A.15.1**, **A.15.2**, **B.1.6**, **C.16**, and **A.10** as applicable, and publish assurance deltas under **B.3**.
* (e) **Objective declaration**: list the **objective vector** (quality, risk, cost, **and any illumination telemetry explicitly promoted into dominance via CAL** with **policy‑id recorded in SCR**) used for Pareto comparison.

**BLP‑2 — Preference Rule.** Given admissibility and comparable assurance (within δ) and budget (within α), prefer the method whose **slope vector** is **Pareto‑dominant** over the audited range (per **BLP‑1c/1e**). If no dominance holds within error bounds, prefer the **more general** method (fewer domain‑specific heuristics, greater transfer via Bridges Φ/Ψ); otherwise resolve via **E/E‑LOG** tie‑breakers declared in policy.

**BLP‑3 — Minimal‑Prescription Default.** Author **rules‑as‑prohibitions** (negative constraints) over step‑by‑step scripts. Encode limits in **Φ policy tables** (and **Φ_plane** where applicable) instead of procedural checklists; allow the agent/system to sequence functions autonomously under those constraints (SoS‑LOG). **Pre/post‑conditions and test harnesses remain permitted**; **scripts** are permissible only when mandated by safety/regulation, or with compelling evidence recorded in the DRR **and reviewed under E.3 precedence / E.5 Guard‑Rails**.

**BLP‑4 — Heuristic‑Debt Register.** Any hand‑tuned rule admitted for pragmatic reasons **MUST** be registered as **Heuristic Debt** with: scope, responsible role, expiry/review window, measurable replacement target under BLP‑2, and a de-hardening/sunset plan. Track in **CalibrationLedger/BCT (Baseline Change Tracker)** and cite in SCR.

**BLP‑5 — Continuous‑Learning Posture.** Where product policy allows, enable **feedback‑driven adaptation** (e.g., preference learning, critique loops) within Guard‑Rails (**E.5**) and privacy/regulatory controls, with appropriate opt‑outs where required. Disabling adaptation requires DRR justification and a review date.

**BLP‑6 — Precedence & Safeguards.** BLP is a **Gov/Arch** policy instantiated by Pillars **P‑10 (Open‑Ended Evolution)**, **P‑11 (SoTA Alignment)**, **P‑7 (Pragmatic Utility)**, and **P‑1 (Cognitive Elegance)**. It does **not** override applicable safety and ethics requirements, **E.5** Guard‑Rails, or E.3 precedence rulings; where BLP conflicts with Guard‑Rails, **Guard‑Rails prevail**. When **NQD/E/E‑LOG** elevates illumination to dominance for exploration mandates, BLP **adopts that lens** rather than overriding it.

*Informative SoTA contexts (post‑2015):* set-returning selection across **LLM prompt‑programming vs fine‑tuned task models**; **preference‑learning families (RLHF ↔ DPO)**; **QD archives (MAP‑Elites/CMA‑ME/DQD/QDax)**; **open‑ended environment–method co‑evolution (POET‑class)**; **offline RL vs Decision Transformer parity**; and beyond ML, **optimization/control** (model‑based planning vs hand‑tuned controllers) and **simulation‑based inference** in the sciences. These are **illustrative only**; use the parity harness instead of single‑winner leaderboards.

### E.2:7 - Conformance Checklist — BLP

| ID            | Requirement                                                                                                     | Purpose                                       |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| **CC‑BLP.1**  | Tolerances **α (budget)** and **δ (assurance)** are declared in the DRR or referenced via policy profile.      | Makes BLP decisions reproducible.             |
| **CC‑BLP.2**  | DRR includes a **Scale‑Audit** (BLP‑1a–e) with published slopes and pinned editions/policy‑IDs.               | Makes scale behavior auditable.               |
| **CC‑BLP.3**  | Selection decision cites **BLP‑2** and lists the governing pillars and precedence checks.                      | Ties choice to constitution.                  |
| **CC‑BLP.4**  | Any admitted heuristic is logged as **Heuristic Debt** with expiry/review and de‑hardening plan.               | Prevents silent drift toward brittle rules.   |
| **CC‑BLP.5**  | Default authoring uses **rules‑as‑prohibitions**; deviations are DRR‑justified and safety‑anchored.            | Preserves agent autonomy under constraints.   |
| **CC‑BLP.6**  | Resource accounts (time/energy/FLOPs) are reported via **A.15.1**, **A.15.2**, **B.1.6**, **C.16**, and **A.10** as applicable, and assurance deltas are reported via **B.3**. | Avoids “free heuristic” illusions. |
| **CC‑BLP.7**  | **Replicate counts/seeds** and **confidence intervals** for slope estimates are recorded.                      | Prevents spurious slope inferences.           |

### E.2:8 - Relations
* **Instantiates pillars:** P‑10, P‑11, P‑7, P‑1.
* **Depends on:** **G.5/G.9** (admission/comparator/selector and parity harness), **G.11** (refresh telemetry), **A.15.1** (dated Work), **A.15.2** (planned work and budgets), **B.1.6** (resource aggregation), **C.16** (resource and cost measurement), and **A.10** (provenance), **C.18** (NQD-CAL), **C.19** (E/E-LOG), and **F.7/F.9** (Bridges, CL/Φ/Ψ). Planned **C.5** (Resrc-CAL) may later consolidate resource-use and work-cost guidance but supplies no current governing semantics.
* **Constrained by:** **E.5** Guard‑Rails (DevOps Lexical Firewall; Notational Independence; Unidirectional Dependency; Cross‑Disciplinary Bias Audit) and **E.3** precedence.

### E.2:9 - Definitions
**α (budget tolerance)** may be relative or absolute; declare units (e.g., % cost, wall‑time, energy). **δ (assurance tolerance)** is the permissible delta in assurance under **B.3**; declare measure and floor(s).

### E.2:10 - Consequences

*Positive*

* Provides an explicit “north star” for every contributor.
* Delivers a falsifiable checklist for evaluating proposals.
* Builds trust in high‑assurance domains through transparency.

*Trade‑offs*

* Constitutional review adds friction to rapid, informal changes.
* Amending the pillar set itself demands high‑bar governance.

### E.2:11 - Rationale

The pillars are distilled from systems engineering, philosophy of science, software architecture, and ontology design. They interlock: *Cognitive Elegance* (P‑1) enables *Didactic Primacy* (P‑2); *Open‑Ended Kernel* (P‑4) and *FPF Layering* (P‑5) make *Open‑Ended Evolution* (P‑10) and *SoTA alignment* (P‑11) feasible; *Cross‑Scale Consistency* (P‑8) provides the algebraic backbone for *Scalable Formality* (P‑3). This minimal yet sufficient set balances stability with change, rigor with accessibility, and abstraction with measurable impact.

`C.29` is a downstream support pattern for this constitution when mathematical first-principles structure is part of an argument about pillar support. It makes the structure, loss, and stop condition explicit while `E.2` remains authority over what counts as a pillar.

### E.2:12 - Relations

* **Depends on:** `E.1` – pillars operationalise the mission.
* **Refined by:** All subsequent patterns in the Core Specification.
* **Mathematical support path:** `C.29` supports pillar-impact arguments only for adequacy of mathematical lenses used to express first-principles structure. It does not amend pillar content, priority, or conformance.
* **Governs:** Every DRR, tool, and pedagogical artefact linked to FPF.

*These pillars are not a cage but the load‑bearing columns of a workshop where ideas can be safely built, dismantled, and evolved.*
