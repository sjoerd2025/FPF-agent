## FPF.Preface:2 - FPF As A Project, Not Only A Pattern List

FPF is a project for improving how difficult reasoning is written, checked, taught, used by humans, and used by AI agents. The Core Specification is the normative center of that project, but it is not the whole project.

The Core Specification gives the pattern language: the named concepts, distinctions, pattern bodies, conformance checks, and relations that make FPF usable across domains. It says what the reasoning objects are and how exact claims are constituted and checked. When a project needs to know whether a diagram is architecture, whether a dashboard is evidence, whether a model output may be used for a decision, or whether a term is hiding several kinds, the Core pattern bodies provide the relevant action- or judgement-guiding content and the definitions or constraints the claim actually needs. A separate `U.MethodDescription`, admitted Method, or exact `ClaimGraph` locator is recovered only when that distinction is current. Evidence use depends on the relation between an exact episteme and a target claim (`A.2.4`), with reliance checked under `A.10`; publication alone does not establish that relation. Actor, ownership, and external-authority claims need their own direct basis.

Other publication families may sit around the Core:

- companion explanations that teach the ideas more slowly;
- worked cases that show FPF on real engineering, research, management, AI, or safety problems;
- tooling guides that explain how to implement FPF written forms, including publication forms, in files, databases, editors, assistants, or review systems;
- project-local adaptations that apply FPF to one organization, product line, discipline, or regulatory environment;
- research notes that discuss adjacent ideas without governing FPF use.

Those companion explanations, tools, project-local adaptations, and examples can be valuable, but they have different jobs. They may teach, demonstrate, implement, translate, or specialize. They do not replace the Core pattern that defines or constrains the claim. If a companion says something more clearly than the Core, the useful explanation can be brought back into a pattern. If a tool makes an FPF form easier to use, the tool still implements the conceptual form; it does not become the conceptual form.

This separation protects both sides. The Core can stay tool-agnostic and pattern-centered. Companions and tools can be vivid, practical, and domain-rich without turning every example into a new norm. The Preface therefore speaks about FPF as a whole project while keeping the boundary clear: patterns define or constrain, companions teach, tools implement, project-local adaptations apply, and examples show.
