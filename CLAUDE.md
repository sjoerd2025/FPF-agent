# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What This Repository Is

The **First Principles Framework (FPF)** specification (~115,000 lines) plus a **Claude Code Skill** that applies FPF to users' coordination problems — without exposing FPF terminology.

- `FPF-Spec.md` — upstream monolith (source of truth, do not edit directly)
- `sections/` — decomposed spec (~380 files), generated from the monolith
- `skills/fpf/SKILL.md` — skill entry point (burden-based routing)
- `agents/fpf-*.md` — agent team (Classifier → Retriever → Reasoner → Reviewer → Sync)
- `.claude-plugin/` — Claude Code plugin manifest (plugin.json + marketplace.json)
- `.codex-plugin/` — Codex CLI plugin manifest (installed via `scripts/install_codex_plugin.py`)
- `scripts/` — Python rebuild pipeline (no external deps)

## Plain Language Contract (non-negotiable)

FPF is **invisible infrastructure**. When the skill is active:
- Users speak their own language ("teams don't understand each other", "how to choose between options")
- Output is in their language — no "holon", "bounded context", "episteme", "transformer quartet", "CharacteristicSpace", pattern IDs, or any FPF terminology
- FPF patterns are applied internally by the Reasoner, never exposed

## Commands

```bash
# Full rebuild (after FPF-Spec.md changes)
./scripts/rebuild_all.sh

# Individual scripts
python3 scripts/split_spec.py          # FPF-Spec.md → sections/ (~380 files)
python3 scripts/build_metadata.py      # ToC → sections/metadata.json (382 entries)
python3 scripts/enrich_metadata.py     # enrich metadata with user-facing queries (RU+EN)
python3 scripts/build_glossary.py      # → sections/glossary-quick.md (50 terms)
python3 scripts/build_lexical.py       # → sections/lexical-rules.md (Part K rules)
python3 scripts/build_routes.py        # → sections/routes/route-{1..10}.md
python3 scripts/build_xrefs.py         # → sections/*/_xref.md (cross-references)

# Semantic search (requires sentence-transformers, faiss-cpu via uv)
uv run scripts/build_embeddings.py     # → sections/embeddings/ (FAISS index)
uv run scripts/semantic_search.py "query text" --top-k 5  # search sections
```

Rebuild scripts use stdlib only. Embedding scripts use `uv run` (auto-installs deps).

```bash
# Smoke tests
python3 scripts/test_smoke.py          # metadata, routes, glossary, xrefs
python3 scripts/test_smoke.py --all    # + semantic search (requires uv)

# Codex CLI plugin
python3 scripts/install_codex_plugin.py   # install/update FPF as a Codex CLI plugin (~/plugins/fpf)
python3 scripts/smoke_codex.py            # smoke-test the Codex plugin packaging
```

## Navigating the Spec

**Do not read FPF-Spec.md directly** — it's ~115K lines. Instead:

1. **By pattern ID** (e.g., A.6, E.17): look up in `sections/metadata.json` → `file` field → read that file
2. **By burden/route**: read `sections/routes/route-{1..10}.md` → follow the section chain
3. **By keyword**: search `sections/metadata.json` `keywords` and `queries` fields
4. **By Part**: read `sections/{directory}/_index.md` for a listing of all sections in that Part
5. **By semantic similarity**: `uv run scripts/semantic_search.py "natural language query" --top-k 5` — uses FAISS + BAAI/bge-m3 multilingual embeddings (1024-dim), works with Russian and English

Pattern IDs are hierarchical: `A.6.P` is a child of `A.6`, which belongs to Part A (dir `04-part-a-kernel-architecture-cluster`).

## Agent Team Architecture

| Agent | Role |
|-------|------|
| **fpf-classifier** | Detects coordination burden from user's natural language, selects route and pipeline depth via strategy table |
| **fpf-retriever** | Loads narrowest relevant sections using tiered retrieval (pattern ID → route chain → cross-refs → keywords → semantic search) |
| **fpf-reasoner** | Applies FPF structure to user's problem, outputs plain language. "Apply, don't explain." Generates structured artifacts (comparison tables, responsibility maps, term sheets, structured breakdowns) |
| **fpf-reviewer** | Validates grounding (claims traceable to sections) + jargon guard (catches FPF terminology leaking into output) |
| **fpf-sync** | Scheduled remote agent: syncs upstream fork, rebuilds sections, AI-enhances _index.md summaries |

Pipeline depth is adaptive: simple term lookups use Retriever → Reasoner (~800 tokens), route-based queries use Retriever → Reasoner (~1200-1500), semantic fallback and cross-cutting queries add Reviewer (~2000-2500). Three-tier architecture: routes as cache (Tier 1), semantic search as fallback (Tier 2), combined for cross-cutting (Tier 3).

## Sync & Rebuild

**Claude Code Remote Routine** (`trig_01P7UzjrjgsgzLpMHn84bMoo`):
- Cron: 1st and 15th of each month, 07:00 UTC (= 09:00 Europe/Belgrade)
- Pipeline: syncs upstream → `bash scripts/rebuild_all.sh` → AI-enhances `_index.md` and `glossary-quick.md` → `/wiki compile` → CHANGELOG What's New → commit + push
- Source of truth for steps: `agents/fpf-sync.md` (the routine reads this file each run)
- Manage at: https://claude.ai/code/routines/trig_01P7UzjrjgsgzLpMHn84bMoo

A previous GitHub Action (`.github/workflows/rebuild-sections.yml`) covered the same flow but consistently failed and was removed — the remote routine replaces it.

## Changelog & Versioning

A PreToolUse hook runs `scripts/update_changelog.py` before every `git commit`.

**Automatic (hook-driven):**
- Parses conventional commit → appends entry to `CHANGELOG.md` under "### All Changes"
- Bumps version in `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`: `feat` → minor, `fix` → patch, `feat!` → major
- `docs`, `test`, `chore`, `perf`, `ci`, `style`, `refactor` → changelog entry but no version bump

**Manual (Claude's responsibility):**
- For `feat:` or `fix:` commits, also update the "### What's New" section in `CHANGELOG.md`
- Write in plain language from the user's perspective, not commit messages
- Group related changes into one bullet point

## Documentation Freshness Automation

Two mechanisms keep the docs from silently drifting as the upstream spec grows:

- **Auto-generated counts** — `scripts/sync_doc_stats.py` recomputes every hard-coded number in `CLAUDE.md` and `Readme.md` (spec lines, section/dir counts, metadata entries, keywords/queries/edges, FAISS vector count) from `FPF-Spec.md` + `sections/metadata.json` and rewrites them. It runs as step 8 of `rebuild_all.sh`, so a rebuild can never leave the numbers stale. The FAISS vector count is derived from metadata (entries with a `file`), so it needs no `uv`/index. `--check` exits 1 on drift (usable as a gate). It handles Russian plural agreement.
- **Wiki-refresh gate** — `scripts/check_wiki_gate.py` is a PreToolUse hook on `git commit`: if the message claims a "wiki refresh/compile/rebuild" but `scanner.py check` reports the wiki is stale, the commit is **denied** (exit 2). This makes the old failure mode — committing "wiki refresh" while `/wiki compile` silently did nothing — impossible. Commits that don't claim a wiki refresh are unaffected.

`CHANGELOG.md` is intentionally **not** a wiki source (the wiki documents the changelog *workflow*, not its entries), so routine changelog appends never make the wiki stale or trip the gate.

## Lexical Rules (enforce when editing the spec)

- **NEVER** "axis" / "dimension" for measurable aspects → **Characteristic**
- **NEVER** "metric" as noun → `U.Measure` / Score
- **NEVER** "applicability" / "envelope" / "generality" as scope names → `U.ClaimScope`, `U.WorkScope`
- Full rules: `sections/lexical-rules.md`

## Ten Entry Routes + Semantic Fallback

| # | User's burden | Route file |
|---|--------------|------------|
| 1 | Teams confused about responsibilities / handoffs | `sections/routes/route-1-project-alignment.md` |
| 2 | Terminology disagreements / vague emerging ideas | `sections/routes/route-2-language-discovery.md` |
| 3 | Contract/SLA/API mixes rules, conditions, obligations | `sections/routes/route-3-boundary-unpacking.md` |
| 4 | Choosing between alternatives / opaque decisions | `sections/routes/route-4-comparison-selection.md` |
| 5 | State-of-the-art survey / portfolio scaffold needed | `sections/routes/route-5-generator-portfolio.md` |
| 6 | Rewrite for different audience / compare text versions | `sections/routes/route-6-rewrite-explanation.md` |
| 7 | Hidden bias / ethical audit / value conflicts | `sections/routes/route-7-ethical-assurance.md` |
| 8 | Trust metrics / overclaim / evidence aggregation | `sections/routes/route-8-trust-assurance.md` |
| 9 | KPIs lie / aggregation mismatch / sum != whole | `sections/routes/route-9-composition-aggregation.md` |
| 10 | Design drift / lessons learned / feedback loops | `sections/routes/route-10-evolution-learning.md` |
| — | Any other FPF-relevant query | Semantic fallback (FAISS + keyword search) |

## Spec Structure (Parts A-K)

| Part | Content |
|------|---------|
| **A** | Kernel: ontology (holons, contexts, roles), transformation quartet, boundary discipline (A.6.*), constitutional principles |
| **B** | Trans-disciplinary reasoning: aggregation, trust calculus (F-G-R), evolution loop, abduction |
| **C** | Extensions: domain calculi, creativity/NQD, measurement, explore/exploit |
| **D** | Multi-scale ethics, conflict optimization |
| **E** | FPF constitution: pillars, authoring protocol, lexical law, multi-view publication (MVPK), DRR governance |
| **F** | Unification suite: concept-sets, SenseCells, bridges, UTS |
| **G** | SoTA patterns kit: harvesting, selector/dispatcher, portfolio governance |
| **H-K** | Glossary, annexes, indexes, lexical debt |

## Wiki

Auto-generated bilingual (RU + EN) documentation at `docs/wiki/`. Maintained by LLM — never edit manually.

- **Structure:** `docs/wiki/ru/` (primary user-facing) and `docs/wiki/en/` (code contributors). Both mirror the same section layout: `modules/`, `agents/`, `routes/`, `architecture/`, `concepts/`.
- **Scope:** Documents the plugin code (scripts, agents, routes, skill). Does NOT document the generated `sections/**` content — those are derived from `FPF-Spec.md` and would duplicate the spec.
- **Update:** `/wiki compile` (incremental) or `/wiki rebuild` (full). When regenerating, always produce BOTH language variants.
- **Check:** `/wiki` or `python3 ~/.claude/skills/wiki/scanner.py check .` (runs automatically before every `git commit` as a non-blocking hook).
- **Q&A:** `/wiki query <question>`.
- **External sources:** add to `docs/wiki/raw/`.
