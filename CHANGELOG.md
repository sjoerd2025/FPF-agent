# Changelog

## 2026-09-15

### What's New
- The searchable spec grew to **115,322 lines** (379 sections, 382 indexed patterns) — its largest expansion to date, covering more specialized domains than ever before.
- **Nineteen domain-specific principle frameworks** (the Engineering DPF Suite) are now part of the index: systems engineering, corporate finance, maintenance engineering, operations management, organization change, strategy, human capability development, management accounting, method engineering, research method practice, semantic integration engineering, and more. When you bring a problem from one of these fields, the skill can now draw on structured domain knowledge rather than general-purpose patterns alone.
- **Mathematical modeling and practice patterns** — new guidance for how to use mathematical structures in a working project: building a first model, connecting physical intuition to formal description, transferring results across domains, and keeping the mathematical and computational views aligned.
- **Narrativization framework** — new support for analyzing or designing how information gets turned into a story, explanation, or publication for an audience.
- **USING-FPF guide** — a new practical onboarding document explaining how to get value from the framework without reading the whole spec first.
- All section indexes were refreshed with plain-language summaries so it is easier to find the right pattern when you're not sure which part of the spec covers your situation.
- The quick glossary was upgraded with plain-language definitions for all 50 key terms.

### All Changes
- **chore**: sync upstream + rebuild + AI-enhanced indexes (v0.12.0)
- **chore**: fix duplicate changelog entry

## 2026-09-01

### What's New
- The searchable spec grew to 107,170 lines (343 sections, 348 indexed patterns) — more situations are covered when you bring a coordination or design problem to the skill.
- New help for **deciding what to do next when work is mid-stream and conditions are changing** — instead of assuming you know the whole plan upfront, you now have a structured way to pick the next action given what's actually true right now, steer work toward a recoverable state, and adjust when a situation shifts during execution.
- New pattern for **figuring out which system is actually implicated** when a consequence or impact is at stake — helpful when "the system" in a statement is vague and different teams might draw the boundary differently.
- New patterns for **recovering what method is actually being used** across multiple instances of similar work — useful when you want to explain what teams are actually doing in common before writing it up as a reusable approach.
- Expanded **trust and assurance calculus** (new B.3 pattern): structured reasoning about what evidence supports a trust claim and where the assurance chain breaks down.
- New help for **temporal claims** — how to tell whether a stated reading is a snapshot, a trend, or an intervention-sensitive change, and what you can legitimately do with each type.
- New pattern for **causal-use discipline**: keeping causal-looking results (correlations, model outputs) within the boundaries of what they were actually built to support — prevents misuse of analysis results.
- New **constraint validity and gate patterns** (A.20, A.21): how to check that a constraint is valid for a transformation step, and how to gate decisions on results from independent checks rather than the same source.
- New **representation selection** pattern (C.37): choosing between representations of the same thing only when the choice actually changes what action you take.
- New **practice architecture synthesis** pattern: combining several independent structural views of a practice into one coherent picture.
- Nine new quick-start **practical-use cards** cover: live work steering, method recovery, getting a bounded result from another practice, naming, system recognition, timing, causal use, measurement, and mathematical modeling — each gives you a fast first move for that type of question.
- Expanded **pattern authoring guidance** (E.8, E.11, E.15): clearer rules for how patterns change across editions, how impact is analyzed, and how to keep pattern publications consistent across framework versions.

### All Changes
- **chore**: sync upstream + rebuild + AI-enhanced indexes + wiki refresh

## 2026-08-15

### What's New
- The searchable spec grew to ~105,000 lines (326 sections, 320 indexed patterns) — more situations are covered when you bring a coordination or design problem to the skill.
- New pattern: **when the word "role" is ambiguous**, the skill can now guide you through recovering what it actually means in your specific claim — is it a classification, an assignment, participation in a relation, a slot in an interface, or ordinary shorthand? This prevents a common confusion where "role" shifts meaning mid-discussion without anyone noticing.
- Major precision upgrade across 30+ patterns: the spec now consistently distinguishes between **what kind of part something plays** (a system-role kind) versus **the act of assigning that part to a specific team or system** — sharper language throughout means fewer cases where the skill's answer is ambiguous about whether it's describing a classification or a commitment.
- Improved pattern entry guidance (E.11 family): clearer instructions for when to use a pattern, what the first useful result looks like, how to recommend patterns to others, and when to stop — making the skill's output more actionable on the first try.

### All Changes
- **chore**: AI-enhance Part C _index.md summaries (75 sections)
- **chore**: AI-enhance Part E _index.md summaries (59 sections)
- **chore**: AI-enhance Parts F and G _index.md summaries (36 sections)


## 2026-08-01

### What's New
- The searchable spec grew to 102,678 lines (325 sections, up from 310) with 33 new patterns — more situations are covered when you bring a coordination or design problem to the skill.
- New help for identifying **which system is really doing something or changing** — when a statement says "the system did X" without naming which boundary you mean, you now have a structured way to find the answer.
- New precision tools for **recovering exactly what relationship is being claimed** when someone says "X relates to Y" without specifying: dependency, causal link, containment, or authority? The new patterns walk you through narrowing it down.
- Clearer guidance on **what it means to be permitted to do something** versus having done it versus not being prohibited — useful for contract and access-control analysis.
- A new pattern connecting **organizational team structure to technical architecture** — so you can reason explicitly about how your org chart shapes what your systems can and can't do.
- New support for typing out what **kind of problem** a messy situation is before you've fully analyzed it — a structured "problem card" for capturing a situation-in-progress.
- New **Role–Method–Work alignment** patterns for keeping distinct: who acts, under what role, by what method, and what the method document says — particularly useful when project or process work overlaps.

### All Changes
- **chore**: sync upstream + rebuild + AI-enhanced indexes

## 2026-07-15

### What's New
- The skill now covers more of the FPF specification — the upstream spec grew to ~97,000 lines (from ~94,000), and the searchable index expanded to 310 topic sections. You get grounded guidance on more situations across every analysis area.
- New help for a common trap: when someone hands you a flowchart, route, checklist, or step-by-step example, the skill can now read it as *the conditions that decide what may legitimately come next* rather than a fixed order everyone must follow — so a teaching example or process diagram isn't mistaken for authorized work or a mandatory sequence.
- New "apply it now" guidance: take a promising approach and turn it into the smallest result you can actually use right away — with clear expectations for what you'll get and when to stop — instead of burying a simple task under paperwork.
- Fifteen new quick-start "use cards" help you jump straight to the right first move for the question your project actually faces, instead of walking a fixed route from the beginning.
- The plain-language topic index and glossary were refreshed for the new material, including a few new everyday terms — whether a stated ability is still up to date, smaller ways of doing that nest inside larger ones, and combining them in an order that matters.

### All Changes
- **chore**: sync upstream FPF-Spec (97 255 lines, 310 sections; new patterns for reading diagrams/flows as constraints-on-what-comes-next, applying a pattern to a first useful result, and fifteen practical-use cards) + full rebuild
- **chore**: port and AI-enhance section _index.md summaries + glossary plain definitions for the new July material
- **chore**: sync upstream July spec + rebuild + AI-enhanced indexes and glossary
- **docs**: wiki compile — refresh overview stats (97K lines, 310 sections, v0.8.0) and bump manifest for July sync

## 2026-07-01

### What's New
- The skill now covers a significantly larger slice of the FPF specification — the upstream spec grew to ~94,000 lines (up from ~86,000), bringing new patterns and refinements across all analysis areas; all 307 sections are indexed and searchable.
- Every section topic now has a plain-language one-sentence description, so the retriever can explain what it's loading without jargon, and you can browse the topic index without reading spec pages.
- All 50 glossary terms now carry plain-language definitions (max 80 characters) so you can quickly check what any key concept helps with, without reading a spec section.

### All Changes
- **chore**: sync upstream FPF-Spec (94 162 lines, 7 new patterns) + full rebuild
- **chore**: AI-enhance all section _index.md with plain-language summaries
- **chore**: AI-enhance glossary-quick.md with plain-language definitions
- **docs**: refresh wiki — updated route chains, architecture overview (94k lines, 307 sections)

## 2026-06-16

### What's New
- The structured-analysis assistant now decides when to engage from concrete real-world situations — ownership disputes between teams, opaque decisions, tangled contracts/SLAs, misleading KPIs, bias audits, terminology disagreements, audience rewrites, and design-vs-reality drift — rather than an abstract "structure your thinking" pitch, and is explicit about staying out of plain coding, refactors, and syntax. This makes it activate more reliably on the problems it's actually meant for.
- When it does engage, its answers are now noticeably more concrete and directly actionable — specific steps with owners, thresholds, and exact wording instead of abstract framing. Blind testing showed the previous output lost to a plain expert answer mainly on actionability; this closes most of that gap and makes the structured breakdown something you can act on immediately.

### All Changes
- **fix**: rewrite fpf skill description for reliable Layer-1 triggering
- **chore**: add trigger-eval harness + interactive fire-rate tool; harden sync routine
- **docs**: refresh wiki after fpf description rewrite + sync-routine invariant
- **fix**: force concreteness in fpf-reasoner output (Principle #1)
- **docs**: add What's New for concreteness fix + align codex manifest to 0.6.2
- **chore**: fix truncated changelog entry
- **fix**: don't truncate changelog entries at apostrophes in update_changelog
- **chore**: align codex manifest to 0.6.3
- **docs**: refresh wiki — reasoner Principle #1, changelog-hook quote-safety, new test article, version 0.6.3

## 2026-06-15

### What's New
- Across-the-board precision upgrade: the spec now explicitly distinguishes between what exists in a system and what is being claimed about it. This means fewer "description drift" errors — where a report or spec quietly shifts from describing reality to asserting interpretation without signaling the shift
- New authoring rule (E.24): when writing about systems, transformations, or decisions, you are now required to be explicit about what's being claimed to exist vs. what's an observation or inference. Reduces hidden ambiguity in requirements and design docs
- New transformation pattern (A.3.4): a dedicated section for describing how transformations work, with greater precision about what the transformation takes as input vs. what it produces vs. what it assumes
- Anti-Goodhart protection extended to quality improvement loops (E.13 upgrade): now explicitly detects "teaching to the test" patterns in improvement initiatives, not just in metrics design. Helps teams notice when an improvement campaign is optimizing the measurement rather than the underlying thing
- Promise-to-Work tracking improvements (E.18.1): cleaner structure for tracing how a commitment becomes actual work, with explicit handling of gaps between what was promised and what was planned
- Refreshed search index: 279 section files (+12 vs. previous sync), 292 metadata entries (+17)

### All Changes
- **chore**: sync upstream FPF (ontic precision migration + E.24 + A.3.4 + E.13 anti-Goodhart upgrade + E.18.1 P2W + 51 upstream commits)
- **chore**: rebuild sections after upstream sync
- **chore**: AI-enhance all _index.md files with plain-language summaries
- **chore**: AI-enhance glossary-quick.md plain-definition column
- **chore**: wiki compile — update timestamps, fix sync-and-rebuild architecture article
- **chore**: sync upstream + rebuild + AI-enhanced indexes + wiki refresh
- **docs**: refresh wiki, correct doc metrics, fix sync routine wiki-compile step
- **docs**: rebuild local FAISS index (239 → 251 vectors) and correct embeddings figures in Readme
- **chore**: auto-generate doc metrics and add a commit gate for a stale wiki
- **chore**: ignore Python bytecode (__pycache__, *.pyc)

## 2026-06-01

### What's New
- Major quality improvement campaign across 217 pattern sections: descriptions are cleaner, more precise, and easier to navigate — the same patterns you know, now significantly more readable
- New tool for vague language: when a knowledge claim's source, interpretation, or precision level is unclear, the new precision-restoration pattern (C.2.P) tells you exactly how to repair it
- New problem-framing record (C.22.2): before a messy situation is formal enough to type, you can now capture it in a structured first-framing card — useful when you know something is wrong but can't yet articulate what
- New tool for mathematical adequacy (C.29): check whether a formal or mathematical model is actually appropriate to use here, not just technically available
- New wording-repair architecture (E.10.ARCH): when a word is doing hidden work in a description, a routing system now tells you which precision-restoration tool applies — for relations, architecture terms, quality claims, functions, or general wording
- Improved discipline-health assessment (C.21): more structured, typed ways to evaluate whether a field of practice is mature enough to be used as a source of evidence
- Refreshed search index: 251 section files (+14 vs previous sync), 275 metadata entries (+17)

### All Changes
- **chore**: sync upstream FPF + rebuild sections (quality campaign + C.2.P + C.21 + C.22.2 + C.29 + E.10.ARCH)
- **chore**: AI-enhance all _index.md files with plain-language summaries
- **chore**: AI-enhance glossary-quick.md with plain-language definitions column
- **chore**: refresh wiki route articles (timestamps updated)

## 2026-05-15

### What's New
- FPF теперь упакован как полноценный плагин для Codex CLI: можно установить через marketplace командой `codex plugin marketplace add pokrovskiyv/FPF-agent` или локальным скриптом `python3 scripts/install_codex_plugin.py`. После установки навык работает из любой рабочей директории, а не только из корня репо FPF-agent
- Новая команда установки: установщик копирует плагин в `~/plugins/fpf/` и регистрирует его в `~/.agents/plugins/marketplace.json` — обновления делаются через `git pull && python3 scripts/install_codex_plugin.py`
- Свежая синхронизация с upstream FPF: добавлена ontology семиотической эпистемы (E.10.SEMIO), допустимые действия в проблемных ситуациях, функциональные описания и новый паттерн A.15.4 work-relevant source restoration, ужесточена терминология в кластере A.6.P и узле F-G-R

- **chore**: rebuild sections after upstream sync
- **feat**: package FPF as Codex CLI plugin with marketplace and installer

## 2026-05-01

### What's New
- New analysis lens for situations where the act of asking changes the answer: Quantum-Like Modeling (C.26) — covers probe-coupled boundary interaction, enacted distributed-state evidence, and viability-envelope regulation. Useful when answers depend on who is measuring or what they are optimizing for
- Explicit handling of "is this claim still true?" — Temporal Claim Adequacy (C.27) distinguishes state readings, temporal trends, and intervention-sensitive change, so stale or context-shifted statements can be detected instead of silently propagating
- New technique for reaching consensus by deliberately reducing precision: Controlled Semantic Coarsening (A.6.3.CSC) — vs. accidentally vague language nobody noticed got loose
- New patterns for "can the people who need this find it, and recognize it as itself across contexts": Recognition Signatures (A.6.RSIG) + First-Practical Entry & Discoverability Discipline (E.11)
- Major rework of how the spec records its own design rationale: Design-Rationale Record method (E.9 DRR) overhaul — improves how decisions, alternatives, and constraints are captured for future review
- Formal math substrate for the Characteristic concept (A.19.SURF-SPACE, A.19.SUPPORT-VIEW) — the term that replaced "axis"/"dimension" everywhere now has an explicit cross-surface layer
- New navigation aids: Detailed Walk-throughs (I.2) and First-Practical Entry Neighborhood Index (J.4)
- Refreshed search index: +10 indexed sections (236 vs. 226), 267 section files (+27), 253 metadata entries (+11)

### All Changes
- **chore**: sync upstream FPF-Spec (temporal claim adequacy + quantum-like cluster + E.9 DRR + A.19.* + recognizability)
- **chore**: rebuild sections after upstream sync
- **docs**: add 'What's New' for upstream sync — describe user-facing additions
- **fix**: complete truncated changelog entry from previous commit
